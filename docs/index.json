We welcome and hope to offer something to participants at any experience level. In every meeting, the presenter first introduces a concept or tool to be used for a challenge or goal. Then, we work on the challenge in pairs or trios (in Zoom \u0026ldquo;breakout rooms\u0026rdquo; while things are online), and finally, we reconvene to see what approaches were taken and which lessons were learned.\nAs the organizers, we are happy to present many of the sessions, but we hope that as a participant, you will also want to do so. For example, you could ask about an actual challenge you are facing in your data analysis, or introduce everyone to an new package you\u0026rsquo;ve been using or are excited about and want to dive into.\nIn the first series, we will focus on all things R: from data analysis and visualization to efficient coding and R Markdown to create just about any document type. There will be no specific topic of analysis; instead, we will focus on building general skills and see them applied to a wide variety of topics.\nEach week, materials and suggested reading will be posted upfront to this website. Like in a Journal Club, some preparatory homework will help you get the most out of it. Each session is intended to be mostly stand-alone to allow for occasional participation.\nThe idea for this Code Club was taken from a paper recently published in PLoS Computational Biology: Ten simple rules to increase computational skills among biologists with Code Clubs.\nTo sign up, please fill out this Google Form.\n   \n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"cfe0079d18632b5cee558f6eaf647081","permalink":"https://mcic2.github.io/about-codeclub/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about-codeclub/","section":"","summary":"About Code Club Code Club is a weekly gathering where we work on practical problems together to improve our coding skills.
