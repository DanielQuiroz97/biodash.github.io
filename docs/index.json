We hope to offer something to participants at any experience level, and to encourage a supportive and fun culture of learning together.\nIn each meeting, a presenter first introduces a concept or tool to be used for a challenge. Then, we work on the challenge in pairs or trios (in Zoom \u0026ldquo;breakout rooms\u0026rdquo;, while things are online), and finally, we reconvene to see what approaches were taken and which lessons were learned.\nThe idea for this Code Club was taken from a recent paper in PLoS Computational Biology: Ten simple rules to increase computational skills among biologists with Code Clubs. We liked this is idea because of the high level of interaction and because gradual, well-spaced practice is an excellent way to retain what you learn.\nJoin us \u0026mdash; and perhaps present a session too! As the organizers, we are happy to present sessions, but we hope that as a participant, you will also want to do so.\nFor example, you could consult the group about an actual challenge you are facing in your data analysis. You could also introduce everyone to an new package or approach you\u0026rsquo;ve been using, or one that you are excited about and want to dive into \u0026ndash; teaching a topic can be one of the best ways to learn it!\nPractical information  In the first series, we will focus on all things R: from data analysis and visualization to efficient coding, R Markdown, and so on. There will be no consistent topic of analysis or data type (e.g. genomic data); instead, we will focus on building and applying general skills to a wide variety of data. Each week, materials and suggested reading will be posted up front at the Episodes page. Like in a Journal Club, doing some preparatory homework by reading these materials will help you get the most out of it. Each session is intended to be mostly stand-alone to allow for occasional participation. To allow for a welcoming environment for participants at all levels of experience, we ask everyone to be respectful and patient when interacting at Code Club. This is not a competitive event.  Sign up To sign up, please fill out the Google Form below.\n Hope to see you at Code Club!\nJelmer Poelstra, Mike Sovic, Stephen Opiyo, and Michael Broe.\nLoadingâ€¦    \n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"cfe0079d18632b5cee558f6eaf647081","permalink":"https://mcic2.github.io/about-codeclub/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about-codeclub/","section":"","summary":"About OSU Code Club OSU Code Club is a weekly gathering where we work on practical problems to improve our coding skills.
