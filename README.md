This is the repo for the BioDASH website at http://biodash.github.io, which hosts bioinformatics materials, a Code Club, and more,
by researchers at OSU.

This website was made using [hugo](http://gohugo.io/) [academic](https://sourcethemes.com/academic) and [hugodown](http://hugodown.r-lib.org/).

The site is built by Hugo whenever a commit is pushed to the master branch of the repo,
and the built website is in the docs/ dir *on the gh-pages* branch.
