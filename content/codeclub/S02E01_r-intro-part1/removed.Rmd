## Need for RStudio Projects

It is good practice to keep a set of related data, analyses, and text
within a single (parent) folder,
and use that folder as the **working directory**.

ILLUSTRATE?

Then, all of the scripts within this folder can use *relative paths* to files
that indicate where inside the project a file is located
(as opposed to *absolute paths*).

</summary>

An **absolute path** always contains the *root element*
(`/` on Unix systems such as Linux and Mac; typically `C:\` on Windows)
and the complete list of directories to locate file.
For that reason, if you move a file around on your computer,
or move it to a different computer, an absolute path will practically never work.
On the other hand, as long as the files remains in the same location,
you can refer to it with an absolute path regardless of where you are on your computer
(i.e., regardless of what you working directory is).

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
C:\Documents\Work\codeclub\scripts\intro-to-R.R  # An absolute path

scripts/intro-to-R.R                             # A relative path
```

A **relative path** assumes a certain starting point (the "working directory"),
so you need to be at the correct starting point for the path to work.
On the other hand, if you keep all files associated with a project within
a single parent directory, and don't change the internal directory structure,
a relative path will keep working even if you move the project directory,
open it on a different computer, or share it with a collaborator.

**You should avoid using absolute paths as much as possible.**

Working with relative paths makes it a lot easier to move your project around
on your computer and share it with others without worrying whether the paths in
the scripts will still work.

However, a challenge of using relative paths is that you need to make sure you are
always at the same starting point (your *working directory*).
RStudio provides a way to
**keep your working directory constant through its "Projects"**.
When you use a Project, your working directory will *always* be the top-level
directory of that project (so we will not need to change our working directory),
and you can safely use relative paths to point to other files.
  
An additional advantage of RStudio Projects is that they will record which files 
you have open in RStudio, and reopen them along with the Project.
This is quite handy when you work on multiple projects.

I would recommend *creating exactly one separate Project for each research project*
with an R component -- and also for things like Code Club.

## Creating an RStudio Project

1. Open RStudio locally or [start an OSC RStudio Server session](/codeclub-setup/#osc-run-rstudio).   

2. *If you're working locally*, create a directory wherever you like on your computer
  for all things Code Club.
  You can do this in RStudio in the `Files` pane (`New Folder` button at the top),
  or outside of R using your file browser.   
  (*If you're at OSC*, skip this step because you're automatically inside
  a Code Club-specific, personal directory.)

3. Click `File` (top menu bar) > `New Project`, select `Existing Directory`, and:
   - *If you're working locally*, select the Code Club directory that you created in the previous step.
   - *If you're working at OSC*, keep the default choice "`~`" (i.e., *home*),
     which is the directory you started in when entering the RStudio Server session.

4. After RStudio automatically reloads,
   you should see the file ending in `.Rproj` in the RStudio `Files` tab in the lower right pane,
   and you will have the Project open. All done for now!

<div>

If you get the pop-up below, click `Don't Save`:

<img src=img/rdata-popup.png width="350">
</p>

</div>
</div>

Now, your working directory should be the Project's directory.
We can check this by executing the `getwd()` (_get working directory_) function:

```{r}
getwd()
```

### Re-opening a Project sometime later

For future Code Club sessions: whenever you open RStudio and this Project is
not automatically opened,
you can open it by choosing `File` > `Open Project` inside RStudio,
or by clicking the `.Rproj` file in your computer's file browser,
which will open RStudio *and* the Project.
