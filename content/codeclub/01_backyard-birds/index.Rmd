## Prep for this week {#prep}


#### Basic computer setup

If you didn't already do this, please follow the [Code Club Computer Setup](/codeclub-setup/) instructions.


#### Test if it works

Please open RStudio locally or [start an OSC RStudio Server session](/codeclub-setup/#osc-run-rstudio).

If you have not used RStudio before, take a moment to explore what's in the panels and tabs.
(It may help to check out [Mike Sovic's 1-minute intro to the RStudio interface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByxF3xjN2JQ&list=PLxhIMi78eQegFm3XqsylVa-Lm7nfiUshe&t=2m15s) 
or [RStudio's 3-minute intro](https://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/520zbd3tij?videoFoam=true).)

If you're able to do so, please open RStudio again a bit before Code Club starts --
and in case you run into issues,
please join the Zoom call early and we'll troubleshoot.

#### New to R?

If you're completely new to R,
it will be useful to have a look at some of the resources listed on our
[New to R?](/codeclub-novice/) page prior to Code Club.

## Create an RStudio Project

Projects are an RStudio-specific concept that create a special file (`.Rproj`),
primarily to designate a directory as the working directory for everything within it.
We recommend creating exactly one separate Project for each research project
with an R component -- 
and for things like Code Club.

<br>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div>

**Why use Projects?**

In brief, Projects help you to organize your work and to make it more portable.
More specifically:

- They record which files (scripts, R Markdown) are open in RStudio,
  and will reopen all of those when you reopen the project.
  This becomes quite handy, say, when you work on three different projects,
  each of which uses a number of scripts.

- An even more significant advantage is that Projects allow you to 
  avoid manually setting your working directory,
  and to use *relative file paths* to refer to files within the project.
  This way, even if you move the project directory,
  or copy it to a different computer,
  the same paths will still work.
  This would not be the case if you used `setwd()` which will generally require
  you to use an absolute path, e.g. `setwd('C:/Users/Jane/Documents/')`.

- Finally, Projects encourage organizing research projects
  inside self-contained directories,
  rather than have files spread around your computer,
  which can save you a lot of headaches and increases reproducibility.
</div>
</div>

<br>

**Let's create an RStudio Project for Code Club:**

- Open RStudio locally or [start an OSC RStudio Server session](/codeclub-setup/#osc-run-rstudio).

- *If you're working locally*, create a directory wherever you like on your computer
  for all things Code Club.
  You can do this in R using `dir.create()`, or outside of R.   
  (*If you're at OSC*, skip this step because you're automatically inside
  a Code Club-specific, personal directory.)

- Click `File` (top menu bar) > `New Project`, and then select `Existing Directory`.
  
  - *If you're working locally*, select the Code Club directory that you created in the previous step.
  
  - *If you're working at OSC*, keep the default choice "`~`" (i.e., *home*),
    which is the directory you started in when entering the RStudio Server session.

- You should now see the file ending in `.Rproj` in the RStudio `Files` tab in the lower right pane.

(To open an existing Project, use `File` > `Open Project` inside RStudio,
or click the `.Rproj` file in your file browser.)

<br>

----

## Orienting ourselves

- **Where are we?** Type in the console (bottom left):
  ```{r}
  getwd()    # short for "get working directory"
  ```

When a Project is open,
the R working directory will always be the directory that contains the `.Rproj` file.
This way, we can refer to all of our files in Code Club
using relative paths starting from that directory,
and have no need for `setwd()`.

- **Create two new directories** -- one for this session,
  and one for a dataset that we will download shortly
  (and will be reusing across sessions):
  ```{r}
  # Dir for Code Club Session 1:
  dir.create('S01')
  
  # Dir for our bird data:
  dir.create('data/birds/', recursive = TRUE) # The "recursive" argument lets us
                                              # create two levels at once
  ```

To keep a record of what we are doing, and to easily modify and rerun earlier commands,
we'll want to save our commands in a script and execute them from there,
rather than typing our commands directly in the console.

- **Open a new R** script using `File` (top menu bar) > `New File` > `R script`.   
  Save the script (`File` > `Save`) as `S01.R` inside your `S01` directory.

- Type a command to **load the _tidyverse_** on the first line of the script:
  ```{r}
  library(tidyverse)
  ```
- **Execute the line**, i.e. to send it to the console, by pressing `Ctrl Enter`.

## The Great Backyard Bird Count

<br>

```{r gbbc-pic, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results='show', out.width="90%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics('GBBC_screenshot.png')
```

<br>

The [Great Backyard Bird Count (GBBC)](https://gbbc.birdcount.org/) is an annual
citizen science event where everyone is encouraged to to identify
and count birds in their backyard -- or anywhere else -- for at least 15 minutes,
and report their sightings online.
Since 2013, it is a global event, but it has been done since 1998 in the US and Canada.

## Getting the bird data

We downloaded a [GBBC dataset](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/82cb293c-f762-11e1-a439-00145eb45e9a)
from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org/).
Because the file was 3.1 GB large, we selected only the records from Ohio
and removed some uninformative columns.
We put the resulting 36 MB file in our Github repo from which we'll download it now.

#### Download the data

We can download the dataset using the `download.file()` function:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
birds_file_url <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biodash/biodash.github.io/master/data/birds/backyard-birds_Ohio.tsv'
birds_file <- 'data/birds/backyard-birds_Ohio.tsv'
download.file(url = birds_file_url, destfile = birds_file)
```

#### Read the data

Now, let's read the file into R.
The `.tsv` extension ("tab-separated values") tells us this is a plain text
file in which columns are separated by tabs,
so we will use a convenience function for exactly this type of file:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
birds <- read_tsv(birds_file)
```

<br>

<div class="alert alert-note">
<div>

**Reading tabular data into R**

Here, we used the `read_tsv()` function from the *readr* package,
which is part of the core set of 8 *tidyverse* packages.
The more general counterpart of this function is `read_delim()`,
which allows you to specify the delimiter using an argument.

There are also functions in "base R" (i.e., they are loaded into R by default,
and not part of the *tidyverse*) that read tabular data,
such as `read.table()` and `read.delim()`.
These are generally a bit slower than the *readr* functions,
and have perhaps less sensible default options to their arguments.
Particularly relevant is how columns with characters (strings) are parsed --
until R 4.0, which was released earlier this year,
base R's default behavior was to parse them as **factors**,
which is generally not desirable.
*readr* functions will never convert character columns to factors.

(You can check which version of R you are running by typing `sessionInfo()`.
You can also check directly how characters are read by default
with `default.stringsAsFactors()`.
To avoid conversion to factors, specify `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` in your
`read.table()` / `read.delim()` function call.)

If speed is important, which it becomes when reading in very large files
(~ 100s of MBs or larger), you should consider using the `fread()` function
from the *data.table* package.

## Exploring backyard birds

**To get a feel for our data**, we can run the following functions:

```{r}
birds          # Simply typing the name of an object will print it to screen
print(birds)   # Same as above, but explicitly calling print()    
str(birds)     # Short for "structure", for column-wise information 
glimpse(birds) # tidyverse version of str()
View(birds)    # In RStudio, will open object in a table in an Rstudio tab.
               # Clicking on the object in the `Environment` pane will do the same!
```

### Your turn: what's in the dataset? 

- Explore the output of the commands above, and try to understand what you see.
  What does a single row represent, and what is in each column?

- In particular, pay attention to the classes and types of the different columns,
  which several of these functions print.

- How many rows and how many columns does the dataset have?

- Write down some simple questions you would like to answer using this dataset.

  </summary>
<br>

- Note that in R, `dbl` (for "double") and `num` (for "numeric") are both used,
  and almost interchangeably so, for floating point numbers.
  (Integers are a separate class that are simply called "integers" and
  abbreviated as `int`,
  but we have no integer columns in this dataset.)

- `read_tsv()` parsed our date as a "date-time" (`dttm` or `POSIXct` for short),
  which contains both a date and a time (this is not a common format for most R users).
  In our case, it looks like the time is always "00:00:00" and thus
  doesn't provide any information.

**Types of data frames**

`data.frame` is R's basic object type that deals with tabular data wherein each
column can contain a different type of data.
When you use base R functions to read in data, you will get a `data.frame` object.
However, when you use *readr*, you will get the *tidyverse*'s **subclass** of `data.frame`:
colloquially called a `tibble` and formally a `tbl_df`.

`tibbles` and "regular" `data.frames` can generally be used interchangeably,
but some default behavior does differ.
Most strikingly, they are printed to screen differently.

To tell what kind of data frame your are dealing with,
and to tell the class of any R object,
use the `class()` function, e.g. `class(birds)`.

:::puzzle
**_Optional: comparing data frame types_**

Read in the bird data as a `data.frame` and compare overviews of the
`tibble` and the `data.frame`.

- What are some differences in how they are displayed and behave?
  In particular, compare what happens when you use `print()`
  (or simply type the object name).

- Were all the columns parsed in the same way -- i.e., did the `tibble` and the
  `data.frame` assign the same class to each column?

- How could you switch (convert) directly between `tibble` and `data.frame` objects?
