## Prep homework {#prep}

### Basic computer setup

- If you didn't already do this, please follow the [Code Club Computer Setup](/codeclub-setup/) instructions, which also has pointers for if you're new to R or RStudio.

- If you're able to do so, please open RStudio a bit before Code Club starts -- and in case you run into issues, please join the Zoom call early and we'll troubleshoot.

### New to dplyr?

If you've never used `dplyr` before (or even if you have), you may find [this cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-transformation.pdf) useful.
