## Prep homework {#prep}

### Basic computer setup

- If you didn't already do this, please follow the [Code Club Computer Setup](/codeclub-setup/) instructions, which also has pointers for if you're new to R or RStudio.

- If you're able to do so, please open RStudio a bit before Code Club starts -- and in case you run into issues, please join the Zoom call early and we'll troubleshoot.

### New to dplyr?

If you've never used `dplyr` before (or even if you have), you may find [this cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-transformation.pdf) useful.

## 1 - What is data wrangling?

It has been estimated that the process of getting your data into the appropriate formats ttakes about 80% of the total time of analysis.  We will talk about formatting as tidy data (e.g., such that each column is a single variable, each row is a single observation, and each cell is a single value, you can learn more about tidy data [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html)) in a future session of Code Club.  

The package [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), as part of the [`tidyverse`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tidyverse/versions/1.3.0) has a number of very helpful functions that will help you get your data into a format suitable for your analysis.  

<br>
<div class="alert alert-note">
<div>

**What will we go over today**

These five core `dplyr()` verbs will help you get wrangling.

- [`select()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html) - picks variables (i.e., columns) based on their names
- [`filter()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html) - picks observations (i.e., rows) based on their values
- [`mutate()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html) - makes new variables, keeps existing columns
- [`arrange()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/arrange.html) - sorts rows based on values in columns
- [`summarize()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html) - reduces values down to a summary form

</div>
</div>

## 2 - Get ready to wrangle

**Let's get set up and grab some data so that we can get familiar with these verbs**

* You can do this locally, or at OSC.  You can find instructions if you are having trouble [here](/codeclub-setup/).

First load your libraries.
```{r, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Then let's access the [iris](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/iris.html) dataset that comes pre-loaded in base R.  We will take that data frame and assign it to a new object called `iris_data`.  Then we will look at our data.
```{r}
iris_data <- iris

# look at the first 6 rows, all columns
head(iris_data)

# check the structure of iris_data
glimpse(iris_data)
```

This dataset contains the measurements (in cm) of `Sepal.Length`, `Sepal.Width`, `Petal.Length`, and `Petal.Width` for three different `Species` of iris, setosa, versicolor, and virginica.   

<br>

----

## 3 - Using `select()`
`select()` allows you to pick certain columns to be included in your data frame.

We will create a dew data frame called iris_petals_species that includes the columns `Species`, `Petal.Length` and `Petal.Width`.

```{r}
iris_petals_species <- iris_data %>%
  select(Species, Petal.Length, Petal.Width)
```

What does our new data frame look like?
```{r}
head(iris_petals_species)
```

**Note - look what happened to the order of the columns!**

<div class="alert alert-warning">
**This is not the only way to select columns.**  

You could also subset by indexing with the square brackets, but you can see how much more readable using `select()` is.  It's nice not to have to refer back to remember what column is which index.

```{r}
iris_data_indexing <- iris_data[,3:5]

head(iris_data_indexing)
```

</div>

<br>

## 4 - Using  `filter()`

Artwork by [@allison_horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations).

`filter()` allows you to pick certain obsevations (i.e, rows) based on their values to be included in your data frame.

We will create a new data frame that only includes information about the irises where their `Species` is setosa.
```{r}
iris_setosa <- iris_data %>%
  filter(Species == "setosa")
```

Let's check the dimensions of our data frame.  Remember, our whole data set is 150 observations, and we are expecting 50 observations per `Species`.
```{r}
dim(iris_setosa)
```

<br>

----

## 5 - Using `mutate()`

Artwork by [@allison_horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations).

`mutate()` allows you to make new variables, while keeping all your existing columns.

Let's make a new column that is the ratio of `Sepal.Length`/`Sepal.Width`
```{r}
iris_sepal_length_to_width <- iris_data %>%
  mutate(Sepal.Length_div_Sepal.Width = Sepal.Length/Sepal.Width)
```

```{r}
head(iris_sepal_length_to_width)
```

**Note -- see the new column location**

<br>

----

## 6 - Using `arrange()`

Very often you will want to order your data frame by some values.  To do this, you can use `arrange()`.

Let's arrange the values in our `iris_data` by `Sepal.Length`.
```{r}
iris_data %>%
  arrange(Sepal.Length)
```

What if we want to arrange by `Sepal.Length`, but within `Species`?  We can do that using the helper [`group_by()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html).

```{r}
iris_data %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  arrange(Sepal.Length)
```

<br>

----

## 7 - Using `summarize()`
By using `summarize()`, you can create a new data frame that has the summary output you have requested.

We can calculate the mean `Sepal.Length` across our dataset.
```{r}
iris_data %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(Sepal.Length))
```

What if we want to calculate means within `Species`?
```{r}
iris_data %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(Sepal.Length))
```

We can integrate some helper functions into our code to simply get out a variety of outputs.  We can use [`across()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/across.html) to apply our summary aross a set of columns.  I really like this function.
```{r}
iris_data %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarize(across(where(is.numeric), mean))
```

This can also be useful for counting observations per group.  Here, how many iris observations do we have per `Species`?
```{r}
iris_data %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  tally()
```

## 8 - Breakout rooms!
### Read in data
Now you try!  We are going to use the Great Backyard Birds dataset we downloaded two weeks ago and you will apply the functions we have learned above to investigate this dataset.

If you weren't here for [Session 1](/codeclub/01_backyard-birds/), get the birds data set.
```{r}
# create a directory called S02
dir.create('S02')

# within S02, create a directory called data, within, a directory called birds
dir.create('data/birds/', recursive = TRUE)
```

Download the file from the internet.
```{r}
# set the location of the file
birds_file_url <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biodash/biodash.github.io/master/assets/data/birds/backyard-birds_Ohio.tsv'

# set the path for the downloaded file
birds_file <- 'data/birds/backyard-birds_Ohio.tsv'

# download 
download.file(url = birds_file_url, destfile = birds_file)
```

If you were here for [Session 1](/codeclub/01_backyard-birds/), join back in!  Let's read in our data.
```{r}
birds_file <- 'data/birds/backyard-birds_Ohio.tsv'
birds <- read_tsv(birds_file)
```
