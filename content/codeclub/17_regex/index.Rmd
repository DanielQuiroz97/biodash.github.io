## New to Code Club?

- If you didn't already do this,
  please follow the [Code Club Computer Setup](/codeclub-setup/) instructions,
  which also has pointers for if you're new to R or RStudio.

- If you're able to do so, please open RStudio a bit before Code Club starts --
  and in case you run into issues,
  please join the Zoom call early and we'll help you troubleshoot.

## 1. Getting set up

While base R also has functions to work with regular expressions (such as `grep()`
and `regexp()`), we will work with the *stringr* package, one of the core
*tidyverse* packages.

```{r}
## If needed, install the tidyverse:
# install.packages("tidyverse")

## Load the tidyverse -- this will include loading "stringr". 
library(tidyverse)
```

To get access to some strings that we can match with regular expressions,
we will use the *bakeoff* data package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## If needed, first install the "remotes" package:
# install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("apreshill/bakeoff")
```

```{r}
library(bakeoff)
```

## 2. Regular expressions: what and why?

You would probably have no trouble recognizing internet and email addresses,
most phone numbers, or a DNA sequence embedded in a piece of text.
And you would do so even if these were presented without context,
and even though you may have never seen that *specific* email address, DNA
sequence, and so on.

We can recognize these things because they adhere to certain patterns:
a DNA sequence, for instance,
typically consists of a sequence of capital As, Cs, Gs, and Ts.

**Regular expressions provide a way to describe and match text that contains
specific patterns to computers**,
with expressions that convey things like *"any digit"* and
*"one or more or the previous character or character type"*.
For example, **`\d{5}`** is a regular expression that matches at least five
consecutive digits and would be a good start to finding all US ZIP codes
contained in some text.

Regular expressions are extremely useful for a couple of related purposes:

- **Finding and extracting information that adheres to patterns**

  - Finding addresses, citations, or identifiers such as accession numbers.
  
  - Finding degenerate primers (or the DNA sequence between them)
    or transcription factor binding sites,
    in which certain positions may vary.
    
  - Finding DNA repeats: you know that something is repeated, but not what is.
    
  - While we often *generalize* and *constrain* matches at the same time,
    we could also merely constrain them:
    
    - Only find instances of "*chocolate*" if it is the first or last word
      of a line/sentence/string.
    
    - Only find instances of "*chocolate*" which are followed by "cake", "tart",
      or "croissant".

<br>

- **Sophisticated find-and-replace**
  
  - Replace multiple variations of the same thing at once:  
    e.g. change all DNA repeats to lowercase letters or Ns.

  - Change a date format from `M/DD/YY` to `YYYY-MM-DD`,
    or GPS coordinates in degrees/minutes/seconds format to decimal degrees
    (note that this needs a bit of conversion too).
  
  - Rename files: switch sample ID and treatment ID separated by underscores,  
    or pad numbers (`1`-`100` => `001`-`100` for proper ordering).

Finally, regular expressions can be used to **parse and convert file formats**,
though you generally don't have to do this yourself unless you are dealing with
highly custom file types.

**Regular expressions are used in nearly all programming languages.
They are also widely used in text editors and therefore provide a first taste of
programming for many people.**

## 3. `str_view()` and strings

Today, to get to know regular expressions, we will just use the `str_view()` function
from the *stringr* package.
Next week, we'll get introduced to other *stringr* functions to search and
also to replace strings.

The basic syntax is `str_view(<target-string(s)>, <search-pattern>)`, for example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
str_view("chocolate", "cola")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="show", out.width="15%", fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/cola.png")
```

`str_view()` shows us which part of the target string was matched in the
`Viewer` pane of RStudio.
This particular match is rather obvious because we searched for a "literal string"
without any special meaning.
However, the visual representation will become useful when we start using special
characters in our regular expressions:
then, we know what *pattern* we should be matching,
but not what *exact string* we actually matched.

If we want to see all matches, and not just the first one, we have to use
`str_view_all`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
str_view("chocolate", "o")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="show", out.width="15%", fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/one_o.png")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
str_view_all("chocolate", "o")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="show", out.width="15%", fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/two_o.png")
```

*stringr* functions are vectorized, so we can use them not just to match a single
string but also to match a vector of strings:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bakes <- c("plum pudding", "chocolate cake", "sticky toffee pudding")
str_view(bakes, "pudding")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="show", out.width="30%", fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/vector1.png")
```

Note that the non-matching string "*chocolate cake*" was displayed despite the
lack of a match.
If we only want to see strings that matched,
we can set the `match` argument to `TRUE`:

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
bakes <- c("plum pudding", "chocolate cake", "sticky toffee pudding")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
str_view(bakes, "pudding", match = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="show", out.width="30%", fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/vector2.png")
```

{{% callout note %}}
**Strings in R**

A "string" or "character string" is a contiguous sequence of characters.
To indicate that something is a string in R, we put quotes around it:
`"Hello"` and `"9"`. If you forget the quotes, R would interpret `"Hello"`
as an *object* (because it starts with a letter) and `"9"` as a *number*
(because it starts with a digit).

There is *no difference* between single quotes (`'Hello'`) and double quotes
(`"Hello"`), but double quotes are generally recommended.

If your string is itself supposed to contain a quote symbol of some kind,
it is convenient to use the *other type* of quote to define the string:

```{r}
# The string contains a single quote, so we use double quotes to define it:
"This cake's 7th layer is particularly good."
```

Alternatively, a quote can be **escaped** using a backslash **`\`** to indicate
that it does *not end the string* but represents a literal quote
*inside the string*,
which may be necessary if a string contains both single and double quotes:

```{r}
"This cake is only 2'4\" tall - do better!"
```

## 4. Special characters

#### Special characters and escaping them

In regular expressions (regex), we need a way to succinctly convey descriptions
such as "any character" or "any digit".
*However, there are no characters exclusive to regular expressions:*
*instead, we re-use normal characters.* For instance:

- "**Any digit**" is represented by **`\d`**, with the **`\`** basically
  preventing the **`d`** from being interpreted literally.
- "**Any character**" is represented by a period, **`.`**

How, then, do we indicate a literal period **`.`** in a regular expression?
The solution is to **escape** it with a backslash:
the regular expression **`\.`** matches a period **`.`**.

{{% callout note %}}

#### TLDR for the rest of this section

**When writing regular expressions as strings in R,**
**we always need to add an extra backslash:**

- The regex **`\d`** matches a digit &mdash; and we write it as **`"\\d"`** in R.
- The regex **`\.`** matches a period &mdash; and we write it as **`"\\."`** in R.

{{% /callout %}}

The "escaping" described above also applies to backslashes, such that the
regex **`\\`** matches a **`\`**.

<br>

#### Escape sequences in regular strings

Outside of regular expressions, R also uses backslashes **`\`** to form
so-called "escape sequences".
This works similarly to how the regular expression **`\d`** means "any digit"
-- for example, when we use **`\n`** *in any string*, it will be interpreted
as a newline:

```{r}
cat("cho\nco")
```

In fact, a single backslash **`\`** is **never taken literally** in any regular R string:

```{r, error=TRUE}
cat("cho\dco")
```

Because this is *not* a regular expression, and **`\d`** does not happen to be
an escape sequence like **`\n`** was earlier, **`\d`** doesn't mean anything to R.
But instead of assuming that the backslash is therefore a literal backslash,
R throws an error, demonstrating that a backslash is always interpreted as the
first character in an escape sequence.

How can we include a backslash in a string, then?
Same as before: we "escape" it with another backslash:

```{r}
cat("bla\\dbla")
```

<br>

#### The backslash plague

We saw that the regular expression **`\d`** matches a digit,
but also that using string **`"\d"`** will merely throw an error!

Therefore, to actually define a regular expression that contains **`\d`**,
we need to use the string **`"\\d"`**:

```{r, error=TRUE}
str_view("The cake has 8 layers", "\d")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
str_view("The cake has 8 layers", "\\d")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="show", out.width="30%", fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/digit1.png")
```

**So, to define any regular expression symbol that contains a backslash,**
**we need to always use two backslashes!**

This also applies when we want to match a literal character.
For example, **to match a literal period, we need the regex `\.`,**
**which we have to write as `\\.` in an R string:**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
str_view("The cake has 8.5 layers", "\\.")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="show", out.width="30%", fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/period2.png")
```

Now to the worst case: what if we want to match a backslash?
We need the regular expression **`\\`**,
but to define that regex as a string,
we have to escape each of the two backslashes --
only to end up with four backslashes!

```{r, error=TRUE}
str_view("C:\\Windows", "\\")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
str_view("C:\\Windows", "\\\\")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="show", out.width="15%", fig.align="left"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/windows.png")
```

Welcome to the backslash plague! ^[Since R 4.0, which was released last year,
there is also a "raw string" or "raw character constant" construct,
which circumvents some of these problems --
see [this blogpost](https://mpopov.com/blog/2020/05/22/strings-in-r-4.x/) that summarizes this new syntax. Because many are not yet using R 4.x, and most current examples,
vignettes, and tutorials on the internet don't use this,
we will stick to being stuck with all the backslashes for now.]

## 5. The Great British Bake Off

<p align="center">
<img src=img/bakeoff.jpg width=60%>
</p>

Let's take a look at some of the data in the *bakeoff* package,
which is about "The Great British Bake Off" (GBBO) television show.

The `bakers` dataframe contains some information about each participant (baker)
in the show, and we will be matching names from the `baker_full` column:

```{r}
head(bakers)
```

The `challenge_results` dataframe contains "signature" and "showstopper" bakes
made by each participant in each episode:

```{r}
head(challenge_results)
```

The "signature" bakes are the first bakes presented in each GBBO episode,
so we'll start trying to match these bakes with regular expressions.
Let's save them in a vector for easy access later on:

```{r}
signatures <- challenge_results$signature     # Assign the column to a vector
signatures <- signatures[!is.na(signatures)]  # Remove NAs

signatures[1:20]                              # Look at the first 20 items
```

## 6. Components of regular expressions

### Literal characters

Literal characters can be a part of regular expressions.
In fact, as we saw in the first example, our entire search pattern for `str_view()`
can perfectly well consist of *only* literal characters.

But the power of regular expressions comes with special characters,
and below, we'll go through several different categories of these.

### Metacharacters

Metacharacters often represent a single instance of **a character type**:
above, we already learned that **`.`** matches *any single character*.

Other metacharacters are actually character combinations starting with a **`\`**:

| Symbol      | Matches                                                | Negation ("anything but")
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------
| **`.`**     | Any single character.                                  |         
| **`\d`**    | Any digit.                                             | **`\D`**
| **`\s`**    | Any white space: space, tab, newline, carriage return. | **`\S`**
| **`\w`**    | Any word character: alphanumeric and underscore.       | **`\W`**
| **`\n`**    | A newline.                                             |         
| **`\t`**    | A tab.                                                 |         

Negated metacharacters match anything except that character type:
**`\D`** matches anything except a digit.

*Some examples:*

- Are there any digits (**`\d`**) in the bake names?

  ```{r, eval=FALSE}
  str_view_all(signatures, "\\d", match = TRUE)
  ```

  ```{r, echo=FALSE, results="show", out.width="27%", fig.align="left"}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/digit2.png")
  ```

<br>

- Let's match 5-character strings that start with "*Ma*":

  ```{r, eval=FALSE}
  str_view_all(signatures, "Ma...", match = TRUE)
  ```

  ```{r, echo=FALSE, results="show", out.width="90%", fig.align="left"}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/ma.png")
  ```
  
  Note that the only constraint we are setting with **`...`** is that
  at least three characters should follow **`Ma`** --
  we are *not* restricting matches to five-character words.
  
<br>

- Let's find the bakers whose (first or last) names contain at least 11
  word characters **`\w`**:

  ```{r, eval=FALSE}
  str_view_all(bakers$baker_full, "\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w\\w", match = TRUE)
  ```
  
  ```{r, echo=FALSE, results="show", out.width="25%", fig.align="left"}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/11letternames.png")
  ```

  It's not very convenient to have to repeat `\\w` so many times!

Or let's say we wanted to get all three-part names:
names that contain three sets of one or more word characters separated
by non-word characters.
How could we describe such a pattern? "Quantifiers" to the rescue!

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers describe how many consecutive instances of the **preceding**
character should be matched:

| Quantifier  | Matches |
|-------------|---------|
| **`*`**     | Preceding character *any number of times* (0 or more).
| **`+`**     | Preceding character *at least* once (1 or more).
| **`?`**     | Preceding character *at most* once (0 or 1).
| **`{n}`**   | Preceding character *exactly `n` times*.
| **`{n,}`**  | Preceding character *at least `n` times*.
| **`{n,m}`** | Preceding character *at least `n` and at most `m` times*.

*Some examples:*

- Names with at least 11 (**`{11,}`**) characters --
  note that this matches the entire word:

  ```{r, eval=FALSE}
  str_view(bakers$baker_full, "\\w{11,}", match=TRUE)
  ```

  ```{r, echo=FALSE, results="show", out.width="25%", fig.align="left"}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/11letternames2.png")
  ```

<br>

- Match names with 2 to 3 (**`{2,3}`**) consecutive "*e*" characters.
  Note that this match encompasses the full string (name),
  because we flank the pattern with **`.*`**.

  ```{r, eval=FALSE}
  str_view(bakers$baker_full, ".*e{2,3}.*", match=TRUE)
  ```
  
  ```{r, echo=FALSE, results="show", out.width="17%", fig.align="left"}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/2or3es_fullmatch.png")
  ```

<br>

- Account for different spelling options with **`?`**
  -- match "*flavor*" or "*flavour*":

  ```{r, eval=FALSE}
  str_view_all(signatures, "flavou?r", match=TRUE)
  ```
  
  ```{r, echo=FALSE, results="show", out.width="65%", fig.align="left"}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/flavor.png")
  ```

<br>

- Match all three-part names -- one or more word characters (**`\w+`**)
  separated by a non-word character (**`\W`**) at least two consecutive times:

  ```{r, eval=FALSE}
  str_view(bakers$baker_full, "\\w+\\W\\w+\\W\\w+", match=TRUE)
  ```

  ```{r, echo=FALSE, results="show", out.width="30%", fig.align="left"}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/3partnames.png")
  ```

<br>

- Match all three-letter names by looking for non-word characters (**`\W`**)
  surrounding three word characters (**`\w{3}`**)?

  ```{r, eval=FALSE}
  str_view_all(bakers$baker_full, "\\W\\w{3}\\W", match = TRUE)
  ```
  ```{r, echo=FALSE, results="show", out.width="30%", fig.align="left"}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/3letternames1.png")
  ```

That last attempt didn't really work --
note that we only got three-letter *middle names*,
since we required our three-letter names to be flanked by non-word characters.
  
To get *all* three-letter names, we need to be able to "anchor" our regular
expressions, e.g. demand that a pattern starts at the beginning of the string.

### Anchors

Anchor       | Matches
-------------|--------
`^`          | Beginning of the string/line
`$`          | End of the string/line
`\b`         | A word *boundary* (beginning or end)

*Some examples:*

- Match all three-letter *first* names,
  by anchoring the three word characters (**`\w{3}`**) 
  to the beginning of the string with **`^`**, and including a space at the end:

  ```{r, eval=FALSE}
  str_view(bakers$baker_full, "^\\w{3} ", match = TRUE)
  ```
  
  ```{r, echo=FALSE, results="show", out.width="23%", fig.align="left"}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/3letterfirstnames.png")
  ```

- Match all three-letter names --whether first, middle, or last--
  using three word-characters (**`\w`**) surrounded by word-boundaries
  (**`\b`**):

  ```{r, eval=FALSE}
  str_view_all(bakers$baker_full, "\\b\\w{3}\\b", match = TRUE)
  ```

  ```{r, echo=FALSE, results="show", out.width="23%", fig.align="left"}
  knitr::include_graphics("img/3letternames2.png")
  ```

#### Regex components for next week

**Regular expressions vs globbing**

Do not confuse regular expressions with *globbing*!

If you have worked in a terminal before,
you may know that you can match file names using *shell wildcards*,
which is known as "globbing".

There are only a few characters used in shell wildcards,
but their meanings differ from regular expressions in two instances!

| Shell wildcard           | Equivalent regex | Meaning
|--------------------------|------------------|--------------------------
| **`?`**                  | **`.`**          | Any single character
| **`*`**                  | **`.*`**         | Any number of any character
| **`[]`** and **`[^]`**   | same!            | Match/negate match of *character class*

- Note also that **`.`** is interpreted as a literal period in globbing.
- We will talk about "character classes" next week.

### Exercise 1

Find all participant names in `bakers$baker_full` that
contain at least 4 lowercase "*e*" characters.
(That, the "*e*"s don't need to be consecutive, but you should not disallow
consecutive "*e*"s either.)

### Bonus exercise

You can use the `list.files()` function in R to list files on your computer.
`list.files()` takes an argument `pattern` to which you can specify a regular
expression in order to narrow down the results.

For example, the code below would find all files with "*codeclub*" in the name,
from your current working directory (the default for the `path` argument)
and downwards (due to `recursive = TRUE`):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
list.files(pattern = "codeclub", recursive = TRUE)
```

You can also specify a path -- for instance, the code below would search your
home or (on Windows) Documents directory and nothing below it:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
list.files(path = "~", pattern = "codeclub") # "~" is your home dir
list.files(path = "C:/Users/myname/Documents", pattern = "codeclub")
```

**Use this function to list only R scripts, i.e. files *ending in* `.R`,**
**in a directory of your choice.**

<details><summary>Hints</summary>

Make sure to use the "end of string" anchor.

</details>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

Here we are searching the the home dir and everything below it --
could take a while, but then you know how many R scripts you actually have!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
list.files(path = "~", pattern = "\\.R$", recursive = TRUE)
```
