## New To Code Club?

-   First, check out the [Code Club Computer Setup](/codeclub-setup/)
    instructions, which also has some pointers that might be helpful if
    you're new to R or RStudio.

-   Please open RStudio before Code Club to test things out -- if you
    run into issues, join the Zoom call early and we'll troubleshoot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Session Goals

-   Learn the uses of R's three basic subsetting operators: `[ ]`, `[[ ]]`, and `$`.
-   Learn how the behavior of these operators varies depending on the **data structure** you are subsetting (vector, matrix, list, or data frame).
-   Prepare to learn how these resemble, and differ from, subsetting operators in Python.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Intro: What is 'subsetting' anyway?

Subsetting (also known as indexing) is simply a formal way of pulling out specific pieces of a data structure. We've already seen two **dplyr** verbs that perform this kind of operation for tibbles: `filter` (to pull out specific rows) and `select` (to pull out specific columns). 

But these are tidyverse commands, and only work with tibbles. R has two more-basic data structures, vectors and lists, and for these we need different subsetting operators. We'll also see that matrices are simply a special kind of vector, that data frames are a special kind of list, and basic subsetting operators also work for these.

Since the behavior of these operators depends on the actual data structure you are working with, it's useful when experimenting to use them in conjunction with the `str()` function, which compactly displays the internal structure of an arbitrary R object. A knowledge of the make-up of these data structures is also important when you come to write your own loops, iterations, and functions.

The most important distinction between vectors and lists is that vectors are **homogeneous**, while lists can be **heterogeneous**.

*Terminological note*: 'under-the-hood' both of these are vectors in the technical sense, and sometimes the distinction is referred to as **atomic vectors** versus **recursive vectors**. I'll continue to use just 'vector' and 'list' here. This usage also lines-up with Python.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Vectors

A vector is absolutely the most basic data structure in R. Every value in a vector must be of the **same type**. Strikingly, this sets R apart from Python. Using this kind of vector in Python requires loading a whole separate package: `numpy`. The most basic data structure in Python is the list.

There are four basic types of vector: integer, double, character, and logical. Vectors are created by hand with the `c()` (combine, concatenate) function. We can check the type with the `typeof()` operator. This is totally redundant if you just created the vector yourself, but when you are debugging code or creating a vector using an expression you might want to check exactly what type of vector is being used:

```{r}
vec_dbl <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
typeof(vec_dbl)
```

```{r}
vec_int <- c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 5L)
typeof(vec_int)
```

```{r}
vec_which <- seq(1, 10)
typeof(vec_which)
```
```{r}
vec_which2 <- 1:10
typeof(vec_which2)
```

```{r}
vec_log <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
typeof(vec_log)
```

```{r}
vec_chr <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")
typeof(vec_chr)
```

What happens when we perform a basci mathematical operation on a vector?
```{r}
2 * vec_int
```

(This is *completely different* than what you obtain when multiplying a Python list).

```python
L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
2 * L
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

So it's not just that vectors are a basic R data structure, but R is a **vectorised language**. In many cases applying an operation to a vector automagically applies the operation to every element in the vector. This means that much of what you need to use for loops and mapping operations in other languages are redundant in R. In Python we could use a 'list comprehension' (a compact and fast version of a `for` loop):

```python
[2 * i for i in L]
# [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

Or install the `numpy` package that makes vectors and vectorized functions available.

## Subsetting vectors

Vectors have an insanely simple structure:

```{r}
str(vec_dbl)
```

RStudio displays the result of `str()` in the Values pane, and `str()` also displays the type.

For such a simple structure, there are a surprisingly large number of ways to subset a vector. We'll use the following example:

```{r}
x <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)
```

(Notice that the number after the decimal point indicates the position (index) of the element of the vector.)

**Positive integers** return elements at the specified positions. Any expression that evaluates to a list of positive integers can be used as the index. The index operator is `[]`:

```{r}
x[3]
x[c(3, 1)]
x[2:4]
x[seq(1, 4, 2)]
```

(In R the indices run from 1 to the length of the object: in Python indices run from 0 to length-1).

**Negative integers** exclude elements at the specified positions:

```{r}
x[-3]
x[-c(3, 1)]
#> [1] 4.2 5.4
```

**Logical vectors** select elements where the corresponding logical value is TRUE. 

```{r}
x[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)]
x[x > 3]
```

**Attributes**. One of the unusual features of R as opposed to Python is that you can assign metadata of various kinds to the elements of vectors (and lists). For example, we can assign a **name** to each element, and then use a character vector as the index expression:

```{r}
y <- c(a = 2.1, b = 4.2, c = 3.3, d = 5.4)
str(y)
y[c("d", "c", "a")]
```

(Again, Python has no direct equivalent of this, but we can get a similar effect using a *dictionary* data structure, which explicilty assigns a name to each value).

**Nothing** returns the entire vector

```{r}
x[]
```

This is not useful for (one dimensional) vectors, but is behind the notation for extracting rows and columns from matrices. Keep in mind a "nothing" index returns "everything".

## Subsetting matrices

A matrix is simply a vector with a **dimensions** attribute. Here we convert a vector to a two-dimensional matrix, with two rows and three columns, with `dim(rows, cols)`.

```{r}
z <- c(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4, 8.5, 1.6)
dim(z) <- c(2, 3)
z
```

Now we can index a specific value using comma notation, where the *first* index specifies the row, and the *second* index the *column* (in Python this is reversed):

```{r}
z[2,3]
```

And in two dimensions the **nothing** after the `,` returns **every** column for that row:

```{r}
z[2,]
```

And here is a way of selecting a submatrix (every row for all columns except the first):

```{r}
z[,-1]
```

## Lists

There are two main differences between vectors and lists: (i) lists can contain elements of **different types**; and (ii) lists can contain **other lists**. This is why lists are sometimes referred to as **recursive vectors**. We will see examples of these below, but first let's directly compare a *list* of numbers to a *vector* of numbers, and examine the structure. Lists are constructed with the `list()` function.

```{r}
l <- list(2.1, 4.2, 3.3, 5.4)
l
str(l)
```

Here we see the appearance of a new subsetting operator `[[ ]]`. What does it yield?

```{r}
ll_2 <- l[[2]]
ll_2
typeof(ll_2)
```

Now compare this to the result of using the `[ ]` operator:

```{r}
l_2 <- l[2]
l_2
typeof(l_2)
str(l_2)
```

The behavior of the `[ ]` operator is very different for lists: it selects the element(s) you request, but *it always returns a subsetted version of the original list*. It 'shrinks' the original list. There is nothing like this in Python; it's quite unique to R. (The reason this is the case will become clear when we examine data frames.) The `[[ ]]` operator on the other hand just returns the object you select.

As mentioned above, it's quite possible that and element of a list might itself be a list:

```{r}
m <- list(2.1, list(4.21, 4.22), 3.3, 5.4)
m
```
This (print) output focuses on content, whereas the `str()` function focuses on structure, and is very useful for nested lists:

```{r}
str(m)
```

Once we combine nested lists and multiple types, things can get pretty hairy. There are various ways to visualize what's going on. Here is one example:

```{r}
x1 <- list(c(1, 2), c(3, 4))
x2 <- list(list(1, 2), list(3, 4))
x3 <- list(1, list(2, list(3)))
```
![](lists_structure.png)

However the printed form provides us a clue on how to extract an individual element from inside a nested list:

```{r}
m[[2]]
```
```{r}
m[[2]][[1]]
```

In short, `[[ ]]` drills down into a list, while `[ ]` returns a diminished version of the original list.

Here's a visualization of various list subsetting operations:

```{r}
a <- list(1:3, "a string", pi, list(-1, -5))
a
str(a)
```

Here is a recursive pepper shaker, `p`

![](shaker.png){width=25%}


Here is the first packet, but still inside the shaker, `p[1]`

![](shaker_first_packet.png){width=25%}

Here is the first packet by itself, `p[[1]]`

![](packet.png){width=25%}

And here is the contents of that packet, `p[[1]][[1]]`

![](pepper.png){width=25%}

We'll play with yet another type of visualization in the exercises.

## Data frames

Let's look at a simple data frame:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c("a", "b", "c"))
typeof(df)
str(df)
```

So a data frame is basically a list (of columns), with a names attribute for the column names; and with the extra condition that all the columns are of the same length. So we should be able to use our standard list subsetting operators on it:

```{r}
df_col_1 <- df[1]
str(df_col_1)
```
Since a data frame is a list, subsetting using `[ ]` returns the specified column still inside a data frame. What about `[[ ]]`?

```{r}
col_1 <- df[[1]]
str(col_1)
```
Using `[[ ]]` returns the individual column. 

We can also subset a data frame by name:

```{r}
df_name <- df["x"]
str(df_name)
```
```{r}
df_nname <- df[["x"]]
str(df_nname)
```

Finally `df$x` is simply a shorthand for `df[["x"]]` without the `[[ ]]` and the `"`:

```{r}
df_dollar_name <- df$x
str(df_dollar_name)
```

Just as a matter of interest, in the grand scheme of things lists are just a special kind of vector (a 'heterogeneous recursive vector'), so it should be possible to stick a list column into a data frame. We can, but we have to use the `I` 'identity' operator around the list:

```{r}
df_mixed <- data.frame(
  x = 1:3, 
  y = I(list(4L, 7.2, "string")))
str(df_mixed)
```
