## New To Code Club?

-   First, check out the [Code Club Computer Setup](/codeclub-setup/)
    instructions, which also has some pointers that might be helpful if
    you're new to R or RStudio.

-   Please open RStudio before Code Club to test things out -- if you
    run into issues, join the Zoom call early and we'll troubleshoot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Session Goals

-   Learn the philosophy of **coding** a graphic.
-   Learn the basic **template** of a **ggplot** graphic, so you can
    reuse it for multiple chart types.
-   Learn how you can quickly add visual information to a graphic using
    **aesthetics** and **layers**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Intro: The ggplot philosophy

We have seen that in R, instead of manually manipulating data frames
with a mouse as you do when editing Excel spreadsheets, we **code** the
operations we want to perform using `dplyr` verbs like `select()`,
`filter()`, `arrange()`, and so on.

In a similar way when performing visualization, instead of clicking on a
chart type in Excel and selecting options, we **code the chart** in R.

And just as `dplyr` gives us efficient ways to manipulate data frames,
`ggplot2` (which is also part of the tidyverse) gives us efficient ways
to manipulate charts/plots/graphics (we use these terms
interchangeably).

The **gg** in **gg**plot2 stands for *grammar of graphics*, a systematic
approach for designing statistical plots developed by Leland Wilkinson.
The idea behind this is to think about 'pulling apart' various plots
into their component pieces, then provide code that could put those
pieces together again in different ways to make new plots.

This notion of pulling apart a graphic leads to the idea of *layers*.
You can build up a plot of any complexity by *overlaying* different
views of the same data.

There's a learning curve here for sure, but there are many advantages.

-   First, *every* graphic shares a **common template**. Once you
    understand this structure you can "say" a lot of different things.  
    (And I mean a *lot*. The [ggplot cheat
    sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)
    lists over 40 plot-types, but because this is a language in its own
    right, users can create their own
    [extensions](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/) that you
    can also utilize, adding over 80 more.)
-   Second, because the graphic is now a piece of code, it is
    *reusable*. Once you have a little library of graphs you've made,
    you can tweak them in various ways to make more. You can also share
    your code with others, so they can apply the same approach to their
    data.
-   Third, the way we put layers together is identical to the way we use
    pipes. You can read `%>%` as *and then*: "`select()` *and then*
    `filter()` *and then* `mutate()`". In graphics, the "and then"
    symbol is `+`: "show this layer, *and then* add this layer, *and
    then* add this layer". In this way you
    can gradually build up a graphic of increasing complexity; or on the
    other hand take someone else's code and simplify it by deleting
    layers.

## A First Example

So how does this work in practice? We'll work through visualizing
aspects of the
[palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) package
which was introduced in [S02E04 Intro to the
Tidyverse](https://biodash.github.io/codeclub/s02e04_tidyverse-intro-part1/).

In addition, **ggplot2** is part of the tidyverse package so we need to
load that as well:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# this assumes you've already installed tidyverse and palmerpenguins with install.packages()

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

And recall that the **penguins** dataset is included in that package:

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

What is the correlation between bill-length and bill-width in these
species?

![](culmen_depth.png){width=50%}

Are longer bills also deeper? We can explore this with a
**scatterplot**.

But first let's look at the `ggplot()` **template**. 

> *Note*: the *package* is **ggplot2**, the *command* is just `ggplot()`.

    ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
      <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))

These are the obligatory parts of any plot: **data**, **geoms**, and
**mappings**. The first argument to `ggplot()` is the data frame:

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins)
```

This is not very interesting! but it's notable that it is *something*.
`ggplot()` has created a base coordinate system (a base layer) that we
can add visual layers to. It's completely uninfomative because we
haven't said how we want the data (or even which data) to be mapped to
graphic elements.

The *add a layer* operator is "**+**", which is the `ggplot` equivalent
of the pipe symbol, and best practice is to **place it at the end of the
line**, just like the pipe. This makes your layers more readable in the
code (and can lead to problems if you put it some other places).

The next argument specifies the kind plot we want: scatterplot, bar
chart, fitted line, boxplot, violin plot, etc, etc. **ggplot2** refers
to these as **geoms**: each different plot-type uses a different
**geom**etrical object to represent data.

You can see an overview of many of these geoms in the [cheat
sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf).The
geom for a scatterplot is `geom_point()`.

But we also require a `mapping` argument, which maps the *variables* or
columns in the dataset we want to focus on to their *visual
representation* in the plot.

And finally we need to specify **aesthetics** for the geometric objects
in the plot, which will control things like shape, color, transparency,
etc. Perhaps surprisingly, the `x` and `y` coordinates of the points are
aesthetics, since these control, not the shape or color, but the
relative **position** of the points in the plot. (After all, flipping
the `x` for `y` in some plots will flip the plot 90 degrees.)

Sounds like a lot when you spell it all out, but it's actually pretty
simple in practice. Here then is our complete first plot:

```{r, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm))
```

Hmmm... the relationship is not very clear, but I guess if you squint
your eyes you can maybe see some local positive correlations? We'll
explore this relationship in more detail below using extra aesthetics.

But let's get coding!

### Exercise 1

:::puzzle

Create a scatterplot comparing body mass and flipper length. Does it
look like there is any correlation?

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The power of aesthetics

We saw above that the relationship between bill length and bill depth is
not particularly clear; but that there *might* be some local
patterns. How can we explore this? Is it possible that these clusters
correspond somehow to the three different species: *Adelie*, *Chinstrap*, and *Gentoo*? Part of the problem with our
original plot may be that we are lumping all the data from all three
species together. We can quickly explore this by adding an extra
aesthetic.

Our current plot uses two **numeric** variables: `bill_length_mm` and
`bill_depth_mm`. We can add a third **categorical** variable, like
`species`, to a two dimensional scatterplot by mapping it to a different
visual aesthetic. We've mapped length and depth to `x,y` coordinates.
Now we'll simultaneously map species to `color` by expanding our list of
aesthetics.

But before we do that, let's improve our plotting commands a little.

First, we have a general `mapping()` argument, which includes a bunch of
*specific* mappings from variables to aesthetics. While I think it's quite useful to be explicit that this is a mapping component, which connects columns with graphical objects,  it turns out we can drop the `mapping =` syntax completely
(and many people do). The very fact we have specific mappings inside `aes()` makes the `mapping =` redundant. I've come to think of it as `syntactic sugar`.

Second, we can actually pipe the dataset into the `ggplot()` command! We
then set the mappings, and then choose our geom in a new layer. This is
very common. Our new syntax looks like this:

```{r, warning = FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point()
```

Now let's add an extra aesthetic for the `species` variable. For this
example we'll use the `color` aesthetic:

```{r, warning = FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```

We get a neat legend on the right hand side for free. It's much clearer
now that, within each species, there does seem to be a positive
correlation between length and depth. It's just that the absolute values
for each species fall in different regions of "bill space".

> *Notice*: We are piping *the entire raw dataset* into the plot here,
while only graphing part of it. The elegance of the pipe syntax is that
we can first pass the dataset through a series of `dplyr` operations -
filtering and mutating etc. - and then pipe that modified dataset
directly into our plotting commands. We'll see more of that in coming
Code Clubs (and Exercise 3)!

### Exercise 2

:::puzzle

Go back to your body_mass/flipper data and color by species, also using our
new syntax.

There are various aesthetics you can use for a categorical variable (see help for geom_point). One
is `shape`. Try this instead of `color` and see which you prefer.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, shape = species)) +
  geom_point()
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The fitted-line geom: `geom_smooth()`

In the scatterplot for bill length vs. bill depth, there wasn't a very
clean overall positive relationship. We can make this even more apparent
visually by fitting a line to the data: *overlaying* another geom in
the same plot.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

> *Technical note*: by default, the `geom_smooth()` function doesn't use
> classical linear regression to fit the data. Instead it uses 
> **lo**cally **e**stimated **s**catterplot **s**moothing:
> [LOESS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression). This snakes
> around and tries to find a more local best fit to the data. You can request
> different fit algorithms with the `method` option. See help for
> `geom_smooth` for details.

But again, this is messy since we are trying to analyze all the data at
once. What if we set the species aesthetic before we apply *any* geom,
so that the aesthetic is inherited by *both* geoms?

```{r, warning=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

Here we can see there does seem to be a strong positive correlation if
we analyze the data species-by-species.

### Exercise 3

:::puzzle

Revisit your flipper/body_mass data, and fit lines to each species. 

There is a lot of overlap between two of the species in the scatterplot, which makes it hard to see the overall patterns for those two species. Does the fitted line overlay help make sense of this?

<details> <summary> Solution (click here) </summary>

```{r, warning=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```
</details>

Perhaps you think this plot is too noisy, with the scatterplot data messing up the basic linear relationships. Modify your plot so it just shows the linear layer without the scatterplot layer.

<br> Remember you can delete layers just as easily as you can add layers.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_smooth()
```

</details>


(Bonus: if you have time...)

Pipe your dataset into a dplyr `filter()` command which pulls out just
the `Gentoo` data; then pipe that data into the `ggplot()` command, to
create a scatterplot, together with a smoothed-line overlay, for just that one species.

<details> <summary> Hints (click here) </summary>

<br> Remember two important things about the filter() function: (i) the check for equality is a double equals sign == (ii) the species name is a character string, not a number, so has to be quoted with "...".

  geom_smooth()
```
