## Understand what is a _ggplot_ extension

A _ggplot_ extension is a set of functions that helps in the automation of a given
task. In the case of _ggplot_ extensions, there are 102 registered extensions
up today.

_ggplot_'s extensions are developed based on the core of _ggplot_ and help to
create a customized plot with certain features such as animation, specific
color scales, or to produce a ready to publish figure.

The [_ggplot_ extensions website](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) has an overview
of the available extensions:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="10in"}
knitr::include_url("https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/")
```

## Define what is _ggpubr_

_ggpubr_ is an R package that produces ggplot-based plots with a more
elegant aesthetic. Although _ggpubr_ has default figures themes, plots usually
require some formatting before sending them for publication.

<br>

## Getting everything ready

First, we can take a look at the data that we are going to use. In this case,
since we are already familiar with *palmerpenguins* dataset, we are going
to continue using this data.

To remember the data structure, we can use the `glimpse` function.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<div>

If you do not have installed the palmergenguins library, you can do it with
this line. If you already have it, skip this line.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

To install the ggpubr package for the first time, you can use this command.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages("ggpubr")
```

</div>
</div>

---

### Loading all required packages

<div class="alert alert-note">
<div>
A good programming style is to load all necessary packages at the very beginning of the script.
</div>
</div>

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)      # To load all packages including in the tidyverse
library(palmerpenguins) # Load the example data
library(ggpubr)         # Create ready to publish figures
```


### Remembering the palmer penguins data

![](./culmen_depth.png)

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

For the downstream example, we are going to contrast the bill depth of
the female vs male penguins of the Adelie species found on the island of Biscoe.

Therefore, we need to filter based on `species == Adelie` and `island == Biscoe`.

```{r}
# Filter by species and island
penguins_filtered <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie", island == "Biscoe")

# Count the occurence of the factors levels of sex, species and island
penguins_filtered %>% count(sex, species, island)
```

### Creating the plot with ggplot

One of the main differences between _ggplot_ and _ggpubr_ is the syntax to 
create the base plot. In the case of _ggplot_, it is a layer based syntax,
while in _ggpubr_, the syntax is embedded in a single function.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins_filtered,
       aes(x = sex, y = bill_depth_mm, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Now, since _ggpubr_ has its own built-in geoms, we can use the 
`ggboxplot()` function:

```{r}
base_plot <- ggboxplot(data = penguins_filtered,
                       x = "sex",
                       y = "bill_depth_mm",
                       fill = "sex")

base_plot
```

<div class="alert alert-note">
<div>

Since _ggpubr_ creates plots based on _ggplot_ syntax, you can treat these plots
as another _ggplot_ figure and use the same functions that you would use to
format base _ggplot_ plots.

</div>
</div>

```{r}
base_plot <- ggboxplot(data = penguins_filtered,
                       x = "sex",
                       y = "bill_depth_mm",
                       fill = "sex") +
  labs(title = "Comparison between Adelie penguins by sex",
       fill = "Sex:",
       x = "Sex",
       y = "Bill depth (mm)")

base_plot
```

## Add statistical results to the density plot

When hypotheses testing is brought to the table, we need to consider which type
of stats we can and cannot apply to our data. Briefly, if our data fits 
the assumptions of being normally distributed and having variance homogeneity, we can
apply parametric tests. On the other hand, if our data does not fit the 
assumptions, we need to apply a nonparametric test to the data.


| Comparison | Parametric    | Nonparametric
| -----------|---------------|-----------
| **2 groups**   | t-test        | Wilcoxon test
| **>2 groups**  | one-way anova | Krustal-Wallis test 

### Checking assumptions

If we would like to conduct a hypotheses test, we need first to check 
assumptions (homogeneity of variance and and normality):

```{r}
bartlett.test(bill_depth_mm ~ sex, data = penguins_filtered)
```


### Exploring the `stat_compare_means()` function

We can use the function `stat_compare_means()` to annotate the plot with
the results of a statistical test comparing group means:

```{r}
base_plot +
  stat_compare_means()
```

In order to be 100% sure about the computed p-value, we can compute 
the Wilcoxon test in the console:

```{r warning=FALSE}
wilcox.test(bill_depth_mm ~ sex, data = penguins_filtered)
```

### Using _ggplot_ to recreate the plot

Above, we created the base plot using _ggpubr_ syntax, but we don't need to do this.
The following code would create a very similar plot using _ggplot_ syntax and
then only adding the `stat_compare_means()` at the end:

```{r}
ggplot(penguins_filtered,
       aes(sex, bill_depth_mm, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  stat_compare_means()
```

### Exercise 1

- Filter the penguins data in order to have only the observations (rows) from
  the Chinstrap species from Dream island.

- Create a boxplot using the _ggpubr_ package or using base _ggplot_.

- Use *stat_compare_means()* function to add a p-value.

- Use the `filter()` function to filter rows
- Filter using `species == Chinstrap` and `island == Dream`
- If you want to use the _ggpubr_ package to create the boxplot,
  use the `ggboxplot()` function.

```{r}
# Using ggpubr

# Filter by species and island
penguins_exc1 <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Chinstrap", island == "Dream")

# Create the plot
exc1_plot <- ggboxplot(data = penguins_exc1,
                       x = "sex",
                       y = "bill_depth_mm",
                       fill = "sex") +
  stat_compare_means()

# Show the plot
exc1_plot
```

```{r}
# Using ggplot only

# Filter by species and island
penguins_exc1 <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Chinstrap", island == "Dream")

# Create the plot
exc1_plot_ggplot <- ggplot(penguins_exc1,
                           aes(sex, bill_depth_mm, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_compare_means() +
  theme_bw()

# Show the plot
exc1_plot_ggplot
```

### Multiple group comparison within a variable

In many experiments we can have multiple groups in a single variable.
For example, within a variable *nutrient concentration* we can have multiple
nutrient concentration levels such as 10%, 20%, 30% and so on.

In the case of the penguins data we can find this layout if we need to 
compare the males bill depth between species. Only for teaching purposes,
we are not going to consider any difference by island.

```{r}
penguins_male <- penguins %>%
  filter(sex == "male")

penguins_male %>% 
  count(species, sex)
```

```{r}
penguins_male_plot <- ggboxplot(penguins_male,
                                x = "species",
                                y = "bill_depth_mm",
                                color = "species")
penguins_male_plot
```

Like before, we can use the function `stat_compare_means` to add a p-value for
an overall comparison between groups:

```{r}
penguins_male_plot +
  stat_compare_means()
```

However, we may also be interested in getting a p-value for the different
pairwise comparisons between groups.
For instance, does the bill depth of Chinstrap penguins differ significantly
from that in Gentoo penguins?

To do this, we can pass a _list_ to that the `stat_compare_means` function.
A list is a flexible, hierarchical R data structure.
Here, we will use a list to store multiple vectors,
each of which contains a pairwise comparison of interest:

```{r}
comparison_list <- list(c("Adelie", "Chinstrap"),
                        c("Chinstrap", "Gentoo"),
                        c("Adelie", "Gentoo"))

penguins_male_plot +
  stat_compare_means(comparisons = comparison_list) +
  stat_compare_means(label.y = 25)
```

                       x = "species",
                       y = "bill_depth_mm",
                       fill = "species")

# Adding the multiple group comparison
exc2_plot <- exc2_plot 

# Creating the pairwise comparison
exc2_comparison <-  list(c("Adelie", "Chinstrap"),
                         c("Chinstrap", "Gentoo"),
                         c("Adelie", "Gentoo"))

exc2_plot <- exc2_plot +
  stat_compare_means(comparisons = comparison_list) +
  stat_compare_means(label.y = 25)
