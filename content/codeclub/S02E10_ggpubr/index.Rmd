## Understand what is a ggplot extension

A ggplot extension is a set of functions that helps in the automation of a given
task. In the case of ggplot extensions, there are 102 registered extensions
up today.

ggplots extensions are developed based in the core of ggplot and helps to
create a customized plot with certain features such as animation, specific
color scales, or to produce a ready to publish figure.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="10in"}
knitr::include_url("https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/")
```


## Define what is ggpubr

ggpubr is an R package that produces ggplot-based plots with a more
elegant aesthetic. Although ggpubr has default figures themes, plots usually
require some formatting before sending them for publication.


## Getting everything ready

First, we can take a look at the data that we are going to use. In this case,
since we are already familiar with *palmerpenguins* dataset, we are going
to continue using this data.

To remember the data structure, we can use the *glimpse* function.

---
**WARNING**

If you do not have installed the palmergenguins library, you can do it with
this line. If you already have it, skip this line.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

To install the ggpubr package for the first time, you can use this command.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages("ggpubr")
```


---

### Loading all required packages

---
**NOTE**

According to the good programming coding style, is better to load all
packages at the very begining of the script.

---

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # To load all packages including in the tidyverse
library(palmerpenguins) # Load the example data
library(ggpubr) # Create ready to publish figures
```


### Remembering palmer penguins data

![](./culmen_depth.png)

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

For the downstream example, we are going to contrast the bill depth of
the female vs male penguins of the Adelie species found in Biscoe island.

Therefore, we need to filter based on *species == Adelie* and *island == Biscoe*.

```{r}
# Filter by species and island
penguins_filtered <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie", island == "Biscoe")

# Count the occurence of the factors levels of sex, species and island
penguins_filtered %>% count(sex, species, island)
```


### Creating the plot with ggplot

One of the main difference between ggplot and ggpubr is the syntax to 
create the plot. In the case of ggplot, it is a layer based syntax,
while in ggpubr, the syntax is embedded in a single function.


```{r}
ggplot(penguins_filtered, aes(x = sex, y = bill_depth_mm, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Now, since ggpubr has its own built-in geoms, the we can use the 
*ggboxplot()* functions.

```{r}
base_plot <- ggboxplot(data = penguins_filtered, x = "sex",
                       y = "bill_depth_mm", fill = "sex")
base_plot
```

---
**NOTE**

Since ggpubr creates plots based on ggplot syntax, can treat these plots
as another ggplot figure and use the same functions that you would use to
format base ggplot plots.

---

```{r}
base_plot <- ggboxplot(data = penguins_filtered, x = "sex",
                       y = "bill_depth_mm", fill = "sex") +
  labs(title = "Comparison between Adelie penguins by sex",
       fill = "Sex:", x = "Sex", y = "Bill depth (mm)")
base_plot
```


---

## Add statistical results to the density plot

When hypotheses testing is brought to the table, we need to consider which type
of stats wee can and cannot apply to our data. Briefly, if our data fits 
the assumptions for normally distribution and variance homogeneity, we can
apply parametric tests. On the other hand, if our data does not fit the 
assumptions, we need to apply non parametric test to the data.


Parametric | Non parametric
--------|-----------
t-test | Wilcoxon test
one-way anova | Krustal-Wallis test 

### Checking assumptions

If we would like to conduct a hypotheses test, we need first to check 
assumptions (homogeneity of variance and and normality)

```{r}
bartlett.test(bill_depth_mm ~ sex, data = penguins_filtered)
```


### Exploring the *stat_compare_means()* functions

```{r}
base_plot + stat_compare_means()
```

In order to be 100% sure about the computed p-value, we can compute 
the Wilcoxon test in the console.

```{r warning=FALSE}
wilcox.test(bill_depth_mm ~ sex, data = penguins_filtered)
```

#### Using ggplot to recreate the plot

```{r}
ggplot(penguins_filtered, aes(sex, bill_depth_mm, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() + theme_bw() + stat_compare_means()
```

### Exercise 1

- Filter the penguins data in order to have only the observations (rows) from
  the Chinstrap specie from the Dream island.

- Create a boxplot using the ggpubr package or using base ggplot.

- Use *stat_compare_means()* function to add p-value

- Use the *filter()* function
- filter by species == Chinstrap and island == Dream
- Use *ggboxplot()* function to create the boxplot
- Use *stat_compare_means()* to add p-value

penguins_exc1 <- penguins %>%

  filter(species == "Chinstrap", island == "Dream")

exc1_plot_ggplot <- ggplot(penguins_exc1, aes(sex, bill_depth_mm, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_compare_means() +

### Multiple group comparison within a variable

In many experiments we can have multiple groups in a single variable.
For example, within the a *nutrient concentration* we can have multiple
nutrient concentration levels such as 10%, 20%, 30% and so on.

In the case of the penguins data we can find this layout if we need to 
compare the males bill depth between species. Only for teaching purposes,
we are not going to consider any difference by island.


```{r}
penguins_male <- penguins %>% filter(sex == "male")
penguins_male %>% count( species, sex)
```

```{r}
penguins_male_plot <- ggboxplot(penguins_male,
                                 x = "species", y = "bill_depth_mm",
                                 color = "species")
penguins_male_plot
```



```{r}
penguins_male_plot + stat_compare_means()
```

```{r}
comparison_list <- list(c("Adelie", "Chinstrap"),
                        c("Chinstrap", "Gentoo"),
                         c("Adelie", "Gentoo"))

penguins_male_plot + stat_compare_means(comparisons = comparison_list) +
  stat_compare_means(label.y = 25)

```
