# Computer setup

Here you will find some information on how to setup your computer to be ready for Code Club.

Local installation of the necessary software may be preferable for yourself,
so you can practice more easily.
But we also have a Classroom Project at the [Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC)](http://osc.edu),
which will allow you to work in RStudio from your browser (and also in a terminal and 
in a Jupyter Notebook for when we cover the command line, bash scripting, and Python).

For now, we just provide instructions for installing/accessing R and RStudio,
since we will use R in our initial sessions.
