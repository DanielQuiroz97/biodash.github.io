# Computer setup

Here, you will find some general information on computer setup for Code Club.
Additional setup for individual sessions (e.g., installing a specific package),
will be stated clearly in the posts for each session.

You may prefer to install the necessary software locally, so you can easily practice
outside of Code Club. Alternatively, you can access RStudio (as well as the terminal
and Jupyter Notebooks) through your browser at the [Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC)](http://osc.edu),
where we have a Classroom Project.

## Local installation

### R and RStudio

### Installing R packages

## OSC

### Sign up at OSC

We will give all Code Club participants access to the OSC Classroom Project for Code Club (`PAS1838`).
This way, you can work e.g. in RStudio from your browser rather than with a local installation.

If you don't already have an OSC account, you do need to sign up by going to https://my.osc.edu/
and clicking the blue "Sign Up" bar.
Then, in the bottom right portion of the form where you provide your info (see screenshot below),
you should enter Code Club's Project Code, which is `PAS1838`.
