## Bioinformatics support

We provide support for data analysis in a variety of ways,
in particular for bioinformatics work on high-throughput sequencing data.
See below for support options with contact details at our various centers,
or fill out the form at the bottom for a general query.

### MCIC

The [Molecular and Cellular Imaging Center (MCIC)](https://mcic.osu.edu/)
is an OSU core facility with locations at the Wooster and Columbus campuses.
Among other things, the MCIC provides end-to-end support for genomics projects ---
from experimental design, library preparation, and sequencing,
to infrastructure for and assistance with data analysis.

The bioinformatics section of the MCIC, the [MCBL (MCIC Computational Biology Laboratory)]((https://mcic.osu.edu/bioinformatics)),
works based on a membership model. MCBL members have access to bioinformatics support,
our project at the Ohio Supercomputer Center for storage and computing,
our two in-house servers, our computer lab in Wooster,
and free access to workshops. 
To become a member, please fill out [this form](https://mcic.osu.edu/bioinformatics/mcbl-registration-form).

For bioinformatics consultation, anyone is free to contact [Jelmer Poelstra](mailto:poelstra.1@osu.edu)
or drop by at the Bioinformatics Office Hour over Zoom every Tuesday between 2 and 4 pm
([Zoom link](https://osu.zoom.us/j/96601785996?pwd=MVUxWWZjdGF6N3BSUGNDL3lmNWZlZz09) -
advance notice is appreciated!).
