## About BioDASH

The BioDASH website is a joint initiative by OSU bioinformaticians at the [Molecular and Cellular Imaging Center (MCIC](https://mcic.osu.edu/);
see also our [Read-The-Docs site](https://mcbl.readthedocs.io/)),
the Center for [Applied Plant Sciences (CAPS)](https://caps.osu.edu/),
and the [Department of Evolution, Ecology and Organismal Biology (EEOB)](https://eeob.osu.edu/).
Here, we collect educational material to empower folks at OSU in using computational tools for their research.

**As of October 2020, this is still very much a work in progress, but more content will be added soon!**
