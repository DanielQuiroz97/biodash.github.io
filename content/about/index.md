## About BioDASH

The BioDASH aims to assemble bioinformatic and computational training resources for researchers at The Ohio State University. It's a joint initiative by bioinformaticians at OSU's [Molecular and Cellular Imaging Center (MCIC)](https://mcic.osu.edu/) - [Computational Biology Lab] (https://mcbl.readthedocs.io/), [Center for Applied Plant Sciences (CAPS)](https://caps.osu.edu/),
and [Department of Evolution, Ecology and Organismal Biology (EEOB)](https://eeob.osu.edu/).

**As of October 2020, this is still very much a work in progress, but more content will be added soon!**
