## About OSU Applied Bioinformatics

This website is a joint initiative by bioinformaticians at two Ohio State University centers:
the [Molecular and Cellular Imaging Center (MCIC](https://mcic.osu.edu/); see also our [Read-The-Docs site](https://mcbl.readthedocs.io/)),
and the Center for [Applied Plant Sciences (CAPS)](https://caps.osu.edu/).
Here, we collect educational material that aims to empower folks at OSU in using computational tools for their research.
