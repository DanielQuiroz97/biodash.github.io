It's a joint initiative by bioinformaticians at OSU's [Molecular and Cellular Imaging Center (MCIC)](https://mcic.osu.edu/) - [Computational Biology Lab](https://mcbl.readthedocs.io/), the [Center for Applied Plant Sciences (CAPS)](https://caps.osu.edu/),
and the [Department of Evolution, Ecology and Organismal Biology (EEOB)](https://eeob.osu.edu/).
