1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.510
Stephen Opiyo: yeah.

2
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.380
Jelmer Poelstra: minutes past.

3
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.280
Jelmer Poelstra: So welcome everybody to today's code club.

4
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.570
Jelmer Poelstra: we're gonna be talking about our markdown today.

5
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.410
Jelmer Poelstra: So markdown is.

6
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.640
Jelmer Poelstra: it's a very nice ecosystem of our packages.

7
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:57.030
Jelmer Poelstra: which you can produce content that not only has our code so so far we've been working with some are skits where we just have the barcode and we produce our results separately.

8
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:12.990
Jelmer Poelstra: But with our markdown you can produce documents that have our code, as well as the results of the code, and that includes figures, as well as other types of results and also nicely formatted pros.

9
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:24.930
Jelmer Poelstra: So this is a really nice way to, for instance, produce reports to show people your results you can even write your papers that way.

10
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:37.140
Jelmer Poelstra: And you could generally instead of using scripts you could replace that if, if you want by using our markdown so that you can include your notes and have your figures, in particular, I feel like for.

11
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.010
Jelmer Poelstra: For exploratory analysis, this is really useful.

12
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.730
Jelmer Poelstra: And so, in order to understand our markdown.

13
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:56.220
Jelmer Poelstra: we're going to need to learn about three new things, so the our part we we take for granted here we've learned about already, but there are three additional elements and.

14
00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.700
Jelmer Poelstra: The first one of that is markdown.

15
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:11.220
Jelmer Poelstra: Which is a very lightweight text formatting language, and the second one is code chunks so these allow us to incorporate the our code that can actually be executed.

16
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:22.740
Jelmer Poelstra: And was results, we can display text figures and tables and then the third thing is is a sort of header with settings that's in a little language called GMO.

17
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.410
Jelmer Poelstra: And that yeah that then determine some settings for a good file.

18
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:43.410
Jelmer Poelstra: And and we're going to mainly talk about html page output, but there are actually many different formats, that you can output to which are markdown files and we'll see a little bit about that about the other options to.

19
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:54.390
Jelmer Poelstra: And at the core they are lockdown ecosystem is the markdown package so if you don't have that installed yet, then this is how you can do that.

20
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.080
Jelmer Poelstra: And, but we don't actually need to load it.

21
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.010
Jelmer Poelstra: And then the other thing to get set up.

22
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.230
Jelmer Poelstra: is to create.

23
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:20.610
Jelmer Poelstra: Inside the directory for club or you know, wherever you have your code club documents to create a directory for this week, so you can do that as follows in the console or you just create a directory, as you might normally do in your in your file explorer.

24
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.610
Jelmer Poelstra: Just make sure you've called this way so seven will use that later.

25
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:39.990
Jelmer Poelstra: And so, first, I think, to see what we're talking about here it's probably good to just actually see an example, so I am so we're going to run to these couple of steps so i'm going to.

26
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:51.420
Jelmer Poelstra: switch to my our studio and show you this, and if you want, you can follow along, otherwise you can just you can just watch.

27
00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:08.220
Jelmer Poelstra: So i'm going to create a markdown file in my studio here so i'm going to click on file and then new file and then our markdown and then we get this dialog box, where we can enter some option so soon as.

28
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.120
Jelmer Poelstra: This room for a title here so i'm going to retitle i'm going to do a markdown DEMO.

29
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:23.220
Jelmer Poelstra: And the author already has my name and for you, it probably has your name and we're going to keep the output format as html.

30
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.950
Jelmer Poelstra: And then we actually get a a document that has that has some content in it already, so this is kind of.

31
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:43.560
Jelmer Poelstra: Our studios way to to to immediately show you what's possible and So here we already have all those three elements that we were talking about, so we have.

32
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:58.890
Jelmer Poelstra: some kind of header we have coach chunks of our hair with some weird format and get we'll talk about, and then we actually have some more or less regular text in here or more coach chunks as well.

33
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.370
Jelmer Poelstra: And so, now we can.

34
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.890
Jelmer Poelstra: Well, first we have to save it.

35
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.110
Jelmer Poelstra: Before we can.

36
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.750
Jelmer Poelstra: Section not responding, for me, you can also immediately.

37
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.410
Jelmer Poelstra: press the nit button, then it will prompt you actually to save it so you need to save it.

38
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.980
Jelmer Poelstra: Before you're able to render it.

39
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.600
save it has marked on DEMO.

40
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:43.440
Jelmer Poelstra: That R amp D to save it as a dot R amp D file and then it immediately renders so the process of producing from your raw markdown file and output file like html it's called rendering.

41
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.020
Jelmer Poelstra: and

42
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.700
Jelmer Poelstra: In in our studio it's, also known as nothing so we knit the file.

43
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.560
Jelmer Poelstra: And now we get this output file, so we can see that.

44
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:07.230
Jelmer Poelstra: We this heather here is not actually shown in, but we have the text that's here with which is somehow converted into some heather's we have.

45
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.470
Jelmer Poelstra: The code is actually displayed and the output of the code, including plots.

46
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:29.430
Jelmer Poelstra: So this is basically just a very quick overview of what our markdown file looks like and what the output looks I can so now what we're going to let me just get rid of that so now we're actually gonna we're going to step through a couple of the different elements.

47
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:41.520
Jelmer Poelstra: And so here also I show a quick side by side overview of a raw file and it's rendered counterpart in html.

48
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:49.170
Jelmer Poelstra: So we'll start now talking a little bit about markdown then we'll talk about coach chunks and then the memo header which are the three.

49
00:06:49.710 --> 00:07:05.370
Jelmer Poelstra: three components that we need to learn about so first markdown, which is a very lightweight language to format plain text file and it actually evolved from simple in my formatting people applied in emails before you get started using html there and i'm sure you've also used.

50
00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:24.750
Jelmer Poelstra: This kind of formatting to emphasize words, by putting Asterix around them, for instance, and so this is one way in which you can make text metallic in markdown so here's a short overview of some commonly used markdown syntax not going to go through this in detail.

51
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:40.080
Jelmer Poelstra: One reason for that being that these days, I still do actually as a visual markdown editor and adult it's almost like using a word processor, so you can also use keyboard shortcuts and press buttons to make things bold or italics.

52
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:50.910
Jelmer Poelstra: But just a few things I do want to highlight, so you can make habit others would have different levels by using pound signs or hashtags.

53
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:58.560
Jelmer Poelstra: With where one pound sign would make the highest level, and so forth, going to smaller levels.

54
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:16.620
Jelmer Poelstra: And then another thing that's important because our mark down in our markdown we're actually going to use a variant of this is presenting how you present code, so when you put back tix around some text, it will be formatted like so as as code.

55
00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:23.700
Jelmer Poelstra: When you can also do is create code blocks so then use tree back tix.

56
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:35.520
Jelmer Poelstra: And then your code which can be any number of lines of code and again align with just three tactics and said, this will produce a code block but what's important to realize is with plain markdown.

57
00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:42.900
Jelmer Poelstra: This will just affect the formatting so really nicely formatted as a cop block, but that doesn't mean that that code can actually run.

58
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.150
Jelmer Poelstra: And so, this is a little example.

59
00:08:49.500 --> 00:09:01.860
Jelmer Poelstra: Where we use some of this formatting so the different heather levels can also include links we can equip figures and one thing that I want to highlight here is how markdown.

60
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:13.470
Jelmer Poelstra: And as white space which can be a little strange when you're not used to it, so, for instance here if we type A single word for line, this is not actually rendered in that way it is.

61
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:20.460
Jelmer Poelstra: It just becomes a regular sentence and another thing that's ignored, are all these extra spaces.

62
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:31.320
Jelmer Poelstra: So if you want to force new lines for some reason, there are a couple ways of doing that and one is by adding two spaces to the end of the line and then starting a new line.

63
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:47.820
Jelmer Poelstra: So that would force line breaks like is done here, so you give us two spaces after can and we've used two spaces after be and then we forced the line breaks and if you leave an empty line between text you'll start a new paragraph so there'll be also an empty line.

64
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.310
into rented put.

65
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:59.040
Jelmer Poelstra: into play markdown files of the extension empty and our markdown files which are the ones that we're going to use have the extension R amp D.

66
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:16.350
Jelmer Poelstra: And then the second aspect is integrating our code, so we saw above that play markdown has syntax for code formatting but the code is not actually going to be executed and what are our markdown allows us to do is, in fact.

67
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:34.470
Jelmer Poelstra: run the code and then we need to use syntax that's just slightly modified so for inline code, so we have an actual sentence and inside that sentence, we want to run some code so, for instance, we want to multiply 265 by 24.

68
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.090
Jelmer Poelstra: So, again we use these back tix, but this time we.

69
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:50.070
Jelmer Poelstra: We put in our just after the first tactic to indicate that this is in the language, and that is code that should be executed in the rendered form will then actually have.

70
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:53.430
Jelmer Poelstra: The sentence and in the sentence.

71
00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.490
Jelmer Poelstra: The number that follows from the calculation.

72
00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.940
Jelmer Poelstra: and similarly coat coat chunks are also.

73
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:07.950
Jelmer Poelstra: similar to the play markdown syntax but now we've put our in curly braces.

74
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:19.200
Jelmer Poelstra: And another thing we can do is actually add inside these curly braces besides just the our options and values so let's see a couple of examples of that.

75
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:30.060
Jelmer Poelstra: So here is a coach chunks code chunk with just default option, so we just put the tree back tix and then are between curly braces and then we put some code.

76
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:37.290
Jelmer Poelstra: And so the way that this will be rendered is that the code will be shown.

77
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:50.850
Jelmer Poelstra: And the output, will also be shown and so some of things we can do with these coach unk options, because sometimes you might not want to actually show either the output, or the code.

78
00:11:51.810 --> 00:12:04.050
Jelmer Poelstra: So one option, for instance, is an ECHO is false and that will mean that the code itself is not displayed So what will happen then in the output is that we do not see the code, but we do see the output.

79
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:26.760
Jelmer Poelstra: And figures can also be printed, so in this case, we also add a caption in the options into chunk options, and so this will be rendered as follows, so we see the the code, we also see a warning that's given us output and then the plot is sprinted.

80
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:33.210
Jelmer Poelstra: As well as the caption that we added to it in here India in the code chunk options.

81
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:40.170
Jelmer Poelstra: And here's just a short overview actually can allow overview of.

82
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:47.700
Jelmer Poelstra: of several code chunk options, so, as I mentioned, sometimes you might not want to print the code sometimes you might not want to print the output.

83
00:12:48.150 --> 00:13:07.080
Jelmer Poelstra: And there are a bunch of different ways, you can deal with this, and this is kind of get can get confusing actually I feel like the the syntax and the options are not incredibly intuitive, but you can refer to a table like this one, to to to do what you need to do in different cases.

84
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:15.420
Jelmer Poelstra: For instance, one thing you could also do is that you might want to print a qr code, but don't run it at all.

85
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:24.720
Jelmer Poelstra: And that's also possible and we use the email is false option and also we just saw that a message was printed or warning was printed.

86
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:34.320
Jelmer Poelstra: And that's something you would you, you probably often want to avoid having printed if you just have some reports that you want to send to collaborators or your advisor.

87
00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:40.860
Jelmer Poelstra: You probably don't want these boilerplate warning, so you can set those off to with messages falls morning is false.

88
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:47.850
Jelmer Poelstra: And then here also are a bunch of options for figures, and this is something in the exercises that you'll be.

89
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:55.050
Jelmer Poelstra: you'll be playing around with a little bit, and you can refer to this overview with the different settings that you can use.

90
00:13:59.550 --> 00:13:59.970
Jelmer Poelstra: and

91
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:14.310
Jelmer Poelstra: In many cases, you might want to have default settings for the entire document so you might make figures in 10 different chunks and you might want every time you might want the same dimensions of those figures.

92
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.950
Jelmer Poelstra: So, in order to avoid having to set them every time you can also do that, and you can.

93
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:35.130
Jelmer Poelstra: call this function of the NATO package to set defaults for the rest of the documents, and this is something that you usually put them in a code chunk at the top of your document and then these options will apply everywhere in your document.

94
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.100
Jelmer Poelstra: And then the third aspect.

95
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:47.700
Jelmer Poelstra: That we'll talk about is the memo header.

96
00:14:49.290 --> 00:15:00.030
Jelmer Poelstra: So yama which stands for yellow ain't markup language is a very simple format and it's often used for configuration files and you can provide key value pairs in it to.

97
00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:11.070
Jelmer Poelstra: To set certain aspects and, in this case, we want to set certain aspects of the output and also we're actually using it as a header.

98
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:29.310
Jelmer Poelstra: We include a heather with some the animal in the file and we put that at the very top of the file, as you saw in the little DEMO so here's an example of a very basic jamo heather so we set the author, we set a title and we set the output type as an html document.

99
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.510
Jelmer Poelstra: And then around the.

100
00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:40.620
Jelmer Poelstra: The actual contents of the mo, how do we put these lines with just three dashes so it has to indicate the start and end of the month.

101
00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:48.150
Jelmer Poelstra: And so, this very simple syntax it does get a little.

102
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.010
Jelmer Poelstra: Strange and in certainly error prone.

103
00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:58.860
Jelmer Poelstra: When you have to add options, so a couple things change so in this case.

104
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:09.390
Jelmer Poelstra: We want to add a couple settings for the output html document so with these options we are adding a table of contents and we letting the table of contents float.

105
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:25.320
Jelmer Poelstra: And so what happens here is that, rather than html document going on the same line it actually goes on a on the next line also it's followed by co loans and it's indented and then the next levels are indented one more level.

106
00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:42.450
Jelmer Poelstra: So it's important to to to do all of that, if you forget the columns here there'll be an error and these errors are not always very clear so so it's it's it's a good point to to take care when you're creating these GMO matters.

107
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:55.260
Jelmer Poelstra: And so, these are two options that you can use for html document and html document is generally the most common output format in there are many.

108
00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:03.630
Jelmer Poelstra: options that you can use and that are quite Nice and just very easy edits to to to.

109
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:15.660
Jelmer Poelstra: To get some nicer formatting or do some other things so, for instance, when you do when you add coach download true you'll you'll have a button in your html file.

110
00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:27.570
Jelmer Poelstra: That will enable people to download the code, you can also have the Code, the code fold so that only people that might be interested in the code can unfold it and then unfold it.

111
00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.440
Jelmer Poelstra: You can add table contents like already mentioned.

112
00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:41.550
Jelmer Poelstra: You can number sections, you can use different things, this is a very easy way to to quickly change the look of.

113
00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:49.620
Jelmer Poelstra: The file so here three different themes that you can use and and that and how that DEMO will then end up looking.

114
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:59.130
Jelmer Poelstra: So those are the two main ingredients so just briefly wanted to touch on our markdown.

115
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.540
Jelmer Poelstra: And how it interacts with our studio so.

116
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.630
Jelmer Poelstra: We already saw that.

117
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:17.100
Jelmer Poelstra: That you can knit your document in our studio with that knit button and there's also keyboard shortcut to do that what you can also do, and let me know.

118
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.040
Jelmer Poelstra: switch back to.

119
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.170
Jelmer Poelstra: Our studio.

120
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:51.780
Jelmer Poelstra: What you can also do is is run individual coaching so there's a couple of buttons if this is a coach unk there's a couple buttons here, including this little play button, which would allow us to run individual coaching.

121
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.080
Jelmer Poelstra: And then another nice thing.

122
00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:02.010
Jelmer Poelstra: Is that you can get a sort of live preview of your markdown document so instead of.

123
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:04.260
Jelmer Poelstra: Instead of.

124
00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:12.060
Jelmer Poelstra: rendering it making changes and then rendering it and making change again a remedy to see what it is, you can.

125
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.890
Jelmer Poelstra: You can use this package, which is called.

126
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:24.000
Jelmer Poelstra: I think it's pronounced something like sharing and and and with that package you can use the.

127
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:36.150
Jelmer Poelstra: infinite Mon reader function, and this will sort of start up a server where your document is it's a sort of being constantly rented so whenever you save the file, it will re render so that's really nice and you can.

128
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:42.420
Jelmer Poelstra: You can maybe try try try that when you're doing the exercises and then the other thing I wanted to show you.

129
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:51.630
Jelmer Poelstra: In our studio now is the visual editor, so this is something that our studio added very recently sometime it a couple months ago.

130
00:19:52.320 --> 00:20:03.000
Jelmer Poelstra: And, as I meant, and you can switch that on by clicking this button here in the top right, and I should mention that you need a very recent version, then of our studio so.

131
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:16.200
Jelmer Poelstra: To be at least 1.4 so you can check help and about our studio and if you're our studio is at least 1.4 you'll have this and otherwise you won't which is not.

132
00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:33.930
Jelmer Poelstra: Not a problem in any way, but you might want to update to explore this option, so if you do have the recent version, you can click this icon here in the top right to switch to the visual editor and then it suddenly starting to look quite difference, and now it looks kind of like a hybrid.

133
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:39.750
Jelmer Poelstra: Between the raw document in the render document so we see that this heather instead of.

134
00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:45.360
Jelmer Poelstra: being displayed with this two hashtags it's actually shown as a very large text.

135
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:57.570
Jelmer Poelstra: kind of like you have an inward and so and the chunks are also displayed a little differently and then there's also and then suddenly you have this toolbar here with all sorts of options.

136
00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:03.330
Jelmer Poelstra: to insert citations to insert pictures and so on, so, then you don't need to remember.

137
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.840
Jelmer Poelstra: Much if any of the markdown syntax.

138
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:12.990
Jelmer Poelstra: Those are two things I wanted to show from our studio.

139
00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:21.840
Jelmer Poelstra: And then finally just briefly, I want to mention so we've been looking a bit of html pages, and this is also what you'll.

140
00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:39.300
Jelmer Poelstra: you'll try in the in the exercises, but there are many different output formats so there's the list of sort of built in output formats, with the our motown package is already pretty long and includes PowerPoint presentations PDF word documents.

141
00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.050
Jelmer Poelstra: html presentations and so on.

142
00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:48.480
Jelmer Poelstra: And then there's also a bunch of extension output format, some of which are really nice.

143
00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:57.600
Jelmer Poelstra: And all that requires it basically that you install a separate package, and then you can start using those so one that's worth mentioning.

144
00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:11.100
Jelmer Poelstra: In particular, is distill which is really good for technical contents, it has very good support for equation citations footnotes and so on, and they're also distill websites that you can create very easily and then articles.

145
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:17.310
Jelmer Poelstra: Is a format, that is, with which you can actually create.

146
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:22.770
Jelmer Poelstra: output, that is formatted the way that specific scientific journals wanted.

147
00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:30.240
Jelmer Poelstra: You can create dashboards you can create books and then this is string and again.

148
00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:42.180
Jelmer Poelstra: The package that as this this infinite memory their function to preview a document in that can also and its main function is to create pretty fancy presentations.

149
00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:48.030
Jelmer Poelstra: So that's all I had pretty introduction.

150
00:22:50.700 --> 00:23:10.050
Jelmer Poelstra: So we can start the breakout rooms and in it, you will work with our markdown file that you can download So if you run these two lines of code, you should get the markdown file and then you can open it up, and if you want, you can then also start up the.

151
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.580
Jelmer Poelstra: The sharing and function to preview your document and then play around.

152
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.100
Jelmer Poelstra: a bunch with this document.

153
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:27.360
Stephen Opiyo: We go to.

154
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:30.240
Stephen Opiyo: break a promo.

155
00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:31.320
Jelmer Poelstra: yeah if you have.
