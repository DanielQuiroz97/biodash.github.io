## MultiQC

MultiQC is a program that *summarizes multiple FastQC results*  
into a single nicely formatted HTML page.

## MultiQC and `conda` at OSC

- MultiQC is *not* available as a module at OSC (i.e., no `module load`).

- The best way to use it is by installing it for yourself
  with the software manager `conda`.
  
  - `conda` can be used without admin rights (which you don't have at OSC),
    and allows you to create "environments" for software.
  
  - In bioinformatics, almost all free software is available through `conda`!
    
  - Like the module system, `conda` allows you to easily maintain multiple
    versions of the same software package, or mutually incompatible software,
    too: you just create separate environments for each of them.

---

## `conda` at OSC

- To use `conda` at OSC, you first need to load a module:

  ```sh
  $ module load python/3.6-conda5.2
  ```
  
  .content-box-info[
  Like with other software, this module needs to be loaded every time you
  want to use `conda`.
  ]

---

## One-time `conda` setup

- Next, `conda` can only be used after a setup script is run.

  We can add code to our bash configuration file that will make sure the
  the setup script is run whenever we log in at OSC.
  
  This is unfortunately made more complicated because the two OSC cluster,
  Owens and Pitzer, have `conda` installed in different locations.

<br>

- The following lines should be added to your `~/.bashrc`:

  ```sh
  if [ -f /apps/python/3.6-conda5.2/etc/profile.d/conda.sh ]; then
      source /apps/python/3.6-conda5.2/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
  elif -f [ /usr/local/python/3.6-conda5.2/etc/profile.d/conda.sh ]; then
      source /usr/local/python/3.6-conda5.2/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
  fi
  ```

---

## One-time `conda` setup (cont.)

- You can add that code by opening up the file (e.g. `nano ~/.bashrc`)
  and pasting it in, or by pasting the following directly into the terminal:

  ```sh
  echo '
  if [ -f /apps/python/3.6-conda5.2/etc/profile.d/conda.sh ]; then
      source /apps/python/3.6-conda5.2/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
  elif -f [ /usr/local/python/3.6-conda5.2/etc/profile.d/conda.sh ]; then
      source /usr/local/python/3.6-conda5.2/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
  fi
  ' >> ~/.bashrc
  ```

--

- To also run the setup script now, we *source* the edited bash config file:

  ```sh
  $ source ~/.bashrc
  ```

  .content-box-info[
  The above setup only needs to be run once &ndash; it does not need to be
  repeated every session.
  ]
  
---

## One-time `conda` setup (cont.)

.content-box-info[
If you for some reason exclusively use one of the two clusters,  
you will only need to add one line to your `~/.bashrc`.

For Pitzer:

```sh
$ echo "source /apps/python/3.6-conda5.2/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
```

For Owens:

```sh
$ echo "source /usr/local/python/3.6-conda5.2/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
```
]

---

## One-time installation of MultiQC <br> into a `conda` environment

- Now, we are ready to create a new `conda` environment,  
  and install MultiQC (and the dependency Python) into it:
  
  ```sh
  # Create a new environment
  # - Confirm with "-y" (avoid being prompted)
  # - Give the environment an arbitrary name with "--name multiqc"
  # - Install python version 3.7 into the environment
  $ conda create -y --name multiqc python=3.7
  
  # Activate the environment:
  $ conda activate multiqc
  
  # Also install multiqc into it
  # - "-c bioconda -c conda-forge" to specify conda "channels"
  $ conda install -y -c bioconda -c conda-forge multiqc
  ```

---

## Running MultiQC

- Whenever you want to use a `conda` environment at OSC,
  you need to first load the module, and then *activate* the `conda` environment
  that you want:

  ```sh
  $ module load python/3.6-conda5.2
  $ conda activate multiqc
  ```

- Having done that, you should be able to run MultiQC:

  ```sh
  $ multiqc --help
  ```

<br>

.content-box-info[
If you didn't manage to create your own conda environment,  
you can also use mine:

```sh
conda activate /users/PAS0471/jelmer/.conda/envs/multiqc
```
]

---

## Running MultiQC

Actually running MultiQC is straightforward:

```sh
# This will put the MultiQC report in the working dir:
$ multiqc <dir-with-fastqc-reports>

# You can also specify the output dir for the MultiQC report: 
$ multiqc <dir-with-fastqc-reports> -o <output-dir>
```

<br>

--

For example, to start an interactive job and run MultiQC there:

```sh
# Start an interactive job at OSC:
$ sinteractive -A PAS0471 # No time specified: will be 30 minutes

$ module load python/3.6-conda5.2
$ conda activate multiqc

$ multiqc results/QC_fastq/ -o results/QC_fastq/
```

---

## MultiQC script

Alternatively, we could create a script that runs MultiQC (next two slides).

---

## MultiQC script - part 1 of 2

```sh
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=PAS0471
#SBATCH --time=60
#SBATCH --out=slurm-multiqc-%j.out

set -e -u -o pipefail

# Save command-line arguments in named variables:
input_dir="$1"
output_dir="$2" 

# If necessary, create the output dir:
mkdir -p "$output_dir"

# Report before starting the pogram:
echo "Starting MultiQC script..."
date
echo "Running MultiQC for dir: $input_dir"
echo "Output dir: $output_dir"
echo "Number of files: $(find "$input_dir" -name "*fastqc.html" | wc -l)"
echo -e "---------\n\n"
```

---

## MultiQC script - part 2 of 2

```sh
# Load the conda module and the MultiQC conda environment:
module load python/3.6-conda5.2
source /apps/python/3.6-conda5.2/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate /users/PAS0471/jelmer/.conda/envs/multiqc

# Run fastqc:
multiqc "$input_dir" -o "$output_dir"

# Report:
echo -e "\n---------\nAll done!"
date
```

.content-box-warning[
In the script, it is necessary to always run the `conda` setup script:

```sh
source /apps/python/3.6-conda5.2/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
```
]

- The script is saved at `scripts/QC_fastq/`.

---

## Running our MultiQC script

- Submitting the script as a job:
  ```sh
  $ dir=results/QC_fastq/
  $ sbatch multiqc.sh $dir $dir
  ```

<br>

- Checking the queue:
  ```sh
  $ squeue -u $USER
  ```

- Checking the output:
  ```sh
  $ ls
  
  $ less slurm*
  
  $ ls $dir/multiqc_report.html
  ```
