<br>

Please use the form below to suggest a topic or concept to be covered at Code Club.
You are also welcome to leave a suggestion relating to the general format, organization,
or presentation of Code Club.

If you suggest a topic, a broad range of suggestions are welcome -- it need not fit neatly as a single Code Club session.
So your suggestion can be as broad as "object-oriented programming" or as specific as a single
R function that you happen to struggle with or that you just really like.
