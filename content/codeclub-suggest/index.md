# Suggest a Code Club Topic!

Please use the form below to suggest a topic or concept to be covered at Code Club.
You are also welcome to leave a suggestion relating to the general format, organization,
or presentation of Code Club.

If you suggest a topic, a broad range of suggestions are welcome -- it need not fit neatly as a single Code Club session.
So your suggestion can be as broad as "object-oriented programming" and can be as specific as a single
R function that you happen to struggle with or that you just really like.

We do note that we prefer to cover topics that could be --at least in principle-- of interest to a broad
range of people, and are not specific to a certain data type. For instance, we would generally be hesitant
to cover in detail the high-level functions of an R package to analyze microbiomic data.
