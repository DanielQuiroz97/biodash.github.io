# Code Club: <br/> Upcoming sessions

<br>

For Nov/Dec 2020, we will do each session twice:
Wednesdays at 5 pm and Fridays at 3 pm.
Please attend whichever one works better for you!

Before you attend for the first time,
make sure to have a look at the [Computer Setup page](/codeclub-setup/),
and especially if you're new to R, at the [Getting Started with R page](/codeclub-novice/).

Here are the dates for the first four sessions:
